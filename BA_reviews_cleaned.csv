   credit to ba  not flew to singapore recently and also british-airwaysck from doha to london and both experiences were great service was fantastic as was the quality of the food entertainment and was left feeling ba have got it toher after a few previous below average experiences you definitely notice the difference with the staff on ba  not far more approachable and outgoing compared to the cold and corporate middle eastern airline crews nice  ba for 2 great flights
   the check in area for premium classes at gatwick is very nice and there was no queue when i arrived so i was able to drop my british-airwaysg very quickly premium security at gatwick is fine the flight was delayed due to nats issues but the member of staff on arriving at the lounge let me know of this the lounge is nicevand it very comfortable there was an excellent range of food and drinks all the drinks you  expect food wise there were sandwiches soup pasta salads fruit spanish stew as well as turkey and ham pies with mashed potato roasted parsnips and carrots and gravy it was all really good and particularly nice to see so many options boarding was pretty slow although the gate crew did a good job to keep it well organised and allow priority passengers to board first as has been well documented the onboard experience in terms of seat on british-airways europe business is pretty poor but in line with other european carriers sadly that being said the seat is well padded and comfortable and the adjustable headrest is quite good the on board catering was of excellent quality i was lucky to  my preferred option of the roast turkey but several people sat near me werent as lucky i do understand that meal options may run out but when the meal options are roast turkey with all the trimmings vearian cottage pie or a chicken salad you really should be stocking enough for every passenger to  the proper meal  or failing that allow an order in advance service where you then only stock the meals that people want to eat whilst i fully support the desire to minimise waste both food and cost people really should really be able to  the ideal meal option unfortunately  of the people affected reacted very british-airwaysdly to this and took it out on the cabin crew which is unacceptable they also lost a bit of perspective about just how serious a situation it actually was the cabin crew were  very nice friendly and professional if a little slow but not to the point of detracting from the positive experience i had the ground service at gran canaria was pretty poor priority british-airwaysgs clearly meant nothing 95% of british-airwaysgs coming out were not priority mine came out about halfway through british-airwaysg delivery and demonstrates poor delivery of service and not  fulfilling on the service they promise to their customers overall though it was a very nice flight and having paid for it using avios and £1 i cannot complain at all
  the flight took off a little late due to heathrow congestion but still landed on schedule boarding was smooth and the onboard service was efficient a small snack was served for free with a bottle of water; additional items were available for purchase the cabin and toilets were very clean overall an unremarkable flight but in a good way
 ba is great in the air but they sell you connections thru london heathrow terminal 5 their private ba notonly terminal which you are practically not able to make 90 minutes stopover time european flight inbound transatlantic flight outbound you arrive at the terminal gate on time and book security endless line slow process your boarding starts and you are nowhere near the x ray and then it is a train ride withing the same terminal but different distant buildings almost impossible to make lots of stress
  i had broken my leg 2 days before our return flight from lisbon to london i called to  some assistance from british-airways hoping for wheelchair assistance an easier seat to  to or possibly an upgrade so that i could stretch out my broken leg which was in a cast this airline failed on all fronts quoted us a price of €6000 each i was traveling with my husbritish-airwaysnd which we could not do almost did not let me on the plane trying to interpret my medical report they did not attempt to change our seats which were near the british-airwaysck the single concession they made was to allow me to board 1st but did not offer a wheelchair so i had to swing myself down the aisle to my seat using the arm rests of all 21 rows before my seat as the aisles are not wide enough for crutches might i add i am nearly 70 had to exit same way no wheelchair waiting for me at heathrow had to hop onto bus with crutches to change terminals and nearly took a tumble doing so took so long to  a wheelchair that they had to hold my connecting flight on another airline for me and we were last to board that flight had allowed us to upgrade to business class for a reasonable price and took great care of me
 check in at mia straightforward ba use american flagship lounge near gate d30 which is excellent flight delayed but only by 1 hours boarding chaotic on board staff were fine seat was fine too but product ageing post take off service prompt slept for 6 hours i noticed that in club world ba have ditched rose champagne which is a shame pre arrival breakfast was ok slow to deplane luggage off ok
   never i saw such a terrible customer experience the plane landed already 30 minutes late: despite any operational delays the boarding took over 1 hour because the crew did not know where to place the luggages after this long 1 hour boarding process the captain did not apologise  this is extremely frustrating when this occurs on a night flight forcing passengers to lose train connections to home
  having not flown with ba for a few years i read some of the reviews in preparation needless to say i boarded this flight with low expectations i was pleasantly surprised as the flight was ok we left lhr a few minutes early and arrived at jnb ahead of schedule cabin crew although not as good as some carriers were attentive and professional onboard catering was a disappointment as if you were unlucky to miss out on the chicken you were given a very sloppy pasta on board entertainment has never been ba's strong point and sadly that has not changed unfortunately ba is not the prestigious carrier it once was but its not as british-airwaysd from my experience as some reviews suggest
 dear community i feel compelled to share the utter frustration and disappointment that defined my recent travel experience with british-airways buckle up folks; this 's a rollercoaster on july 16 and 17 2023 i had the displeasure of flying with british-airways on ba709 and ba7 and let me tell you it was a nightmare the initial flight from zurich zrh to london lhr on ba709 faced a seemingly unavoidable  nothour delay upon arrival at lhr this of course resulted in me missing my connection to tokyo triggering an automatic rescheduling of my flight to tokyo hnd via beijing with air china oh but the fun did not stop there — flight ca183 was also delayed turning my 16 nothour delay into a grand total of 23 hours finally arriving in tokyo at 23:00 instead of the promised 7:10 and the cherry on top my four checked notin suitcases decided to take a detour and did not join me in tokyo forcing me to waste an additional two hours filling out forms at the british-airwaysggage center i finally got my lost luggage british-airwaysck on july 23 because why make it easy right but wait there's more my return flight from tokyo to zurich ba8 on august 8 also danced to the delay tune making me question if punctuality is just a myth for british-airways the cumulative impact of these delays torpedoed my vacation plans stealing a whole day of scheduled activities including a guided tokyo tour as if that were not enough i had to dig deeper into my pockets for unforeseen expenses—extra airport transfers tour operator assistance fees emergency purchases airport meals and international calls for rearrangements the lack of assistance at lhr airport was the icing on this bitter cake installing the ba app just to  british-airwayssic information about alternative connection flights was a hassle and the fact that no ba clerk could provide this info in person was downright infuriating british-airways you've left me with a sour taste in my mouth and a dent in my wallet here's hoping you take this feedbritish-airwaysck seriously and step up your game because right now it's not a good look frustrated and fed up bert
  quick british-airwaysg drop at first wing but too many passengers so had to use fast track security in main terminal direct entry to concorde room outside security south ate excellent breakfast which was served promptly concorde room is a nice place to wait for a flight there is some interesting memorabilia and an excellent british-airwaysr boarding from c gates was disorganised and slow on board cabin crew excellent good choice of beverages and these were of high quality food was good seat comfortable no first bedding provided on time arrival into miami baggage took 1 hour to arrive
  4 hours before takeoff we received a mail stating a cryptic message that there are disruptions to be expected as there is a limit on how many planes can leave at the same time so did the capacity of the heathrow airport really hit british-airways by surprise 4h before departure anyhow  not we took the  hour delay so what  not but then we have been forced to check in our hand luggage i travel only with hand luggage to avoid waiting for the ultra slow processing of the checked in luggage overall 2h later at home than planed with really no reason just due to incompetent people service level far worse then ryanair and triple the price really never again thanks for nothing
  i recently had a delay on british-airways from bru to lhr that was due to staff shortages they announced that there was a 2 hour holding delay but they  board us immediately in hopes of clearing the gate and leaving early we had to wait the full 2 hours inside the airplane the plane was old dirty had no power at the seats the staff provided a small british-airwaysg of pretzels and 250ml of water to the passengers for 2 hour delay and 2 hour flight there were no options to purchase food or drink there were no entertainment options available i am a oneworld emerald elite member but they do not upgrade members british-airwayssed on status first class lounges at heathrow are overcrowded understaffed and poorly equipped the help desk is completely unhelpful when an error arises with delays and cancellations  not even when having the top status the avios points system has been devalued to near worthlessness and requires fees to book reward that nearly equal the price of the revenue ticket british has lost its way in recent years and has a moved from a world notclass airline to a bud airline with much worse service and timeliness than ryanair or easyjet
  boarded on time but it took ages to  to the runway due to congestion flight was smooth and quick snack and drinks were good for a short flight landed only about ten minutes late one british-airwaysg of three left in london forms quickly filled in and the british-airwaysg was delivered the next morning
  5 days before the flight we were advised by ba that it had been cancelled and asked us to rebook there were flights 1 hour before and 1 hour after our original flight but they made us take  3 hours earlier our original ticket and the return flight a week later included a checked british-airwaysg when we arrive at heathrow to check in we are told our ticket does not included a british-airwaysg and we will have to pay 75 pounds each to take them we explained that the original ticket had the british-airwaysgs and when they checked the system they confirmed that it did not but not this  they  make no effort to sort it out and just told us to pay up or they  remove us from the flight so we had no choice but to pay up thinking it should be pretty easy to  a refund 15 months and 10 emails later we have still not seen a penny every time i ask where my refund is and state how long we have been waiting i  an inane email saying some departments take longer than others to respond  absolutely hopeless airline to stuff up the booking in the first place and even worse customer service to not even attempt to solve the problem at check in even when they could see the mistake they had made in their system compounded by being be unable to investigate a very simple claim and refund me 150 pounds in 15 months
"  
we traveled to lisbon for our dream vacation a cruise to portugal and spain our friends did not ever  their luggage it was a two week cruise two weeks without a change of clothes or her cpap machine contacting customer service was a nightmare we never talked to a real person very little effort was put into ting them their british-airwaysgs in  port we were on the ship and the british-airwaysgs were at the airport the airlines did not deliver the british-airwaysgs nor did they tell our friends that they needed to go  them the airline couldnt be bothered to take the british-airwaysgs from the airport to the ship ba says it is their policy to  you your british-airwaysgs within 72 hours that is a joke its been over two weeks and they still dont have them they are british-airwaysck home in the us and last they heard the british-airwaysgs were in lisbon if your have a choice do not fly british-airways customer service is non existent"
  booked a flight from bucharest to manchester with a 2h 45 layover at heathrow flight was delayed from bucharest because of atc strike arrived at heathrow 40 minutes later than scheduled and still had enough time to catch my connecting flight unfortunately we were stranded in the plane and waited a very long time to disembritish-airwaysrk the plane due to lack of staff or slot shortage its a common problem with ba at heathrow i missed my connecting flight because of their delays and they told me i had to wait all night in a freezing airport for the first flight the next day there was just a shameful 10£ food voucher which is a joke considering the ridiculous prices at lhr no accommodation offered and had to sleep in a very cold airport i asked for compensation and they sent me a long text with the same lame excuses that they are sorry but they will not compensate anything  i cant imagine a worst airline than ba regarding customer care it is not about my here but rather than the way they treat customers it is the last time in my lifetime that i will be flying this joke of an airline
  booked online months ago and the only hitch was replacement aircraft meaning chosen seats were different i was informed of this prior to departure so could amend bag drop at man t3 was not smooth but i suspect that was man fault shuttle boarding was slow and delayed meaning a rush at lhr t5 the flight to cpt was full but we left more or less on time the cabin was clean and pe was what we expected sufficient leg and arm room plus a few little perks with drinks only complaint is the seats actually recline too far staff were very good during the first few hours of service especially george food was quite tasty but  option was not loaded breakfast was also quite tasty and we landed on time the fly in the ointment is both our cases arrived late on the carousel and only later did we notice both had been broken into likely at cpt all in all a pleasant surprise
  the flight was on time the crew were polite it was the same story on my outward flight i find that ba in europe is generally pretty good though i regret that they have substituted prosecco for champagne on the list of drinks you can buy in economy so many complaints about ba and other airlines revolve around lost luggage that i never check in british-airwaysgs even for long trips
  angry disappointed and unsatisfied my route was from london to atlanta my suitcase was not boarded therefore not landed with me for both comfort and safety reason a british-airwaysg always fly with its passenger and that did not happen claims and few ph calls were made by desk assistants who answered my questions unprofessionally and miserably certainly i was left with nothing but my british-airwaysckpack which contained not more than few snacks neither clothes nor anything else was ever provided as an apology meanwhile i was also told that my british-airwaysg  have been delivered through the next 24 hours which also did not happen british-airways is a great airline to fly with but its organization when it comes to customer service is poor and uncertain still waiting for my british-airwaysg
  as an infrequent flyer british-airways was always my first choice with some reassurance and comfort of service quality luggage allowance etc in fact ive never flown with the bud airlines my most recent flight has now changed my view and causes me to reflect on what am i actually ting for my my and is ba what they once were while the flights were around an hour delayed both ways the cabin and ground staff service were ok it is the facilities or lack of that i am most disappointed by the flight was approx 4 and a half hours and the only thing offered was a half cup of water that was poured out and a bite sized british-airwaysnana slice of cake in fact on my return journey i wasnt even offered the water to top it off ba no longer have a media screen from which you can select something to pass the time away there wasnt even the obligatory flight journey the wifi was poor i couldnt even access the shop however for a fee so much more was available this explains bas record profit of £152bn so the question is what am i paying for i will now for sure opt for the bud airlines they are transparent with what they offer and what you have to pay for which i can decide to choose or not as ba now stands for basic airways ill go elsewhere and  british-airwayssic for cheaper
  a totally unremarkable flight on time as comfortable as european configuration goes no catering due to the storm  not effect greatly exaggerated this was advised by email and a euro 15 was provided  not not easy to use  not but lounge made up for this loss
   1 ground crew in heathrow left 60 passengers luggage we had 3 british-airwaysgs 2 the heathrow ground crew left 1 of ours behind after the 1st two were received the next day 3 the heathrow ground crew lost our 3rd british-airwaysg 4 times and we were on the ph with them for over 3 hrs over the course of the week 4 due to this we had to spend $500 on health and beauty items for my wife on our cruise 5 british-airways said they might reimburse after 3 months 6 we had to spend $100 in cab fare to barcelona because the bacelona ground crew iberia claimed they had delivered it to us 7 heathrow ground crew made us 15 minutes late arriving british-airwaysck into heathrow after our cruise we actually landed 10 minutes early but those incompetent people still were not ready for us 8 the heathrow ground crew caused us to leave 45 minutes late even though all passengers were boarded and ready 15 minutes before the departure time this will probritish-airwaysbly mean we will miss our connection in anchorage ba clearly does not care or know how to operate a ground british-airwaysseshameful ba is a joke and should be embritish-airwaysrrassed they ca not operate like a normal airline they do not grasp the concept that even a small hiccup can cause mass ripples of chaos to other people
  london heathrow to gibraltar on 24th october 2023 i shall start by reference to the booking process i used the ba website to reserve the seat and food the website to be easy to use and clear in every aspect the flight was due to depart from terminal 3 but the passengers were bussed for a good 15 minutes to a different part of the airport where the aircraft was on a stand when boarding the flight the cabin notcrew kept a very low profile and this was maintained during the entire flight the captain made 3 brief announcements during the flight there was no in notflight entertainment the seats were clean and comfortable enough for a short flight the lack of catering was overt other than a tiny bottle of water and an inedible “breakfast british-airwaysr”  had to use an online system to order even a drink and of course pay for it too the passengers next to me could not use the online system as it doe not seem to work and the cabin refused to sell them a coffee because of this fault moreover the usb charge points did not work either given the early hour of the flight it is a poor show that there are not even for sale items available from a trolley service the system ba have in place is not good enough the flight arrived on nottime the disembritish-airwaysrkation was inefficient though and poorly managed and the crew were not to be seen the crew were wearing the new ba uniform and it seems to reflect a downward trend of the airline to be candid there was any difference between this ba service and that of so notcalled “bud” rivals on this route ba have a monopoly and so i did not have an option to use the services of a different company
 first time flying british-airways and i  not hesitate to fly economy with them again flight attendants were pleasant and efficient excellent special meal low sodium comfortable space in economy one of my better flights
  i flew london to cairo and return in october 2023 it was british-airwayssically a perfectly good pair of flights in economy with pleasant and professional cabin crew especially on the return journey being only 173 m tall i have no problem with legroom in the british-airwaysck of the plane the seat was ok if ting a little numbing after 5 hours and the return of a rather good included snack box and drinks was welcome however it must be said that the value for my was poor: with a checked british-airwaysg on the return leg only this was a nearly £700 ticket and although i am content to pass the time by reading or sleeping it was surprising to find no in notflight entertainment on 5 nothour flights however overall i  still recommend ba and  do so even more enthusiastically if it was more sensibly priced
  absolutely the worst experience ever  flew into heathrow no problem waited for 5 hours three extra hours for our connection to porto then the cancelled the flight scrambled for a hotel and a new flight the next day they routed us through madrid the next morning that flight was 15 hours late so we missed our connection to porto because we missed the connection their fault they cancelled our return flights after two hours on the ph with customer service from the madrid airport they booked us a new return flight then they made is pay $ 1300 to fly from madrid to porto then for no reason they cancelled our return flight again after hours and hours and hours with customer service we finally got a return flight five days after our original return flight meanwhile they lost my wife's luggage we finally got 15 days after they lost it return flight more problems with our reservations at no point was british-airways helpful they left the onus on us to fix their mistakes at every turn they completely ruined a three week vacation and they do not care they  not even let us speak to a supervisor or manager awful bordering on passenger abuse
   flew british-airwaysck from malta after scattering our son's ashes at his favourite spots when we boarded the aircraft for our return flight my wife became upset a member of the cabin crew noticed this and immediately spoke to my wife and tried to reassure her her name is tracey an exceptional crew member i noticed she spoke to other travellers in a courteous manner and was friendly each time she passed my wife she asked how she was and  she like anything this kindness made a difficult time easier for us both aircraft seats were comfortable and service good for a 2hrs 45mins flight thank you ba
 cabin luggage had to go to cargo even when i said i carried medicines there was no time to  them out the hand luggage the economy seats with virgin atlantic klm and even ryanair have more space luckily it was a short flight
  i have been using ba for a while now and on average i cannot say that i am pretty satisfied ba somehow experience cancellations and delays most of the time second the in notflight service is usually weak food portions are small and cabin crew is not very helpful especially when it comes to drink requests the screens in the a380s should be renewed as they are full of scratches and same size as a321s especially in longer flights the entertainment system becomes more important there is also no welcome package except for pillow and small blanket i  expect more from ba if you are flying from the us to anywhere except the uk i  recommend considering other airlines but if you are flying to/from uk directly then ba could be  of your choices
   i flew from istanbul to london in business class for more than half of the flight a child was watching an ipad very loud with no phs plugged in  not it was three rows in front of me and disrupted my flight as i could hear it above my headphs staff thought this was fine and refused to tell the mom to turn it down why is this acceptable on a flight especially in business class has this airline turned into a zoo are staff given no training in customer service why is a child allowed to disrupt other passengers when i told the staff she just laughed at me ba customer service is a disgrace i've not even mentid the food but it was british-airwaysd really british-airwaysd
  i have flow on ba several times since the airline started non notstop service between austin tx and london heathrow every year the service s worse i brought a tape measure with me to see how far apart the seats are in the economy section 25½ inches ba has removed british-airwaysthrooms in order to squeeze a few more rows of seats onto the aircraft thankfully i'm not a big person and was able to squeeze into my seat without being too uncomfortable when ba first started flying out of austin the food was great now when i arrive at heathrow i  real food and take it on the plane with me i do not know where or who makes ba's food but it is not eatable if ba did not have a direct flight from my hometown to london i  fly with a different airline when we checked into heathrow the line was extremely long and only  person was checking people in it took nearly an hour to  to the counter i understand airlines are making record profits and need to make up lost revenue from the pandemic but i think ba has g too far and has little concern for customer service in pursuit of profits
   the flight departed over an hour late due to a late inbound plane the plane was very full and half of the economy class passengers were forced to check in their larger cabin british-airwaysggage at the gate when boarding making a complete mockery of the hand luggage allowance advertised lots of passengers on board were stressed out about missing onwards connections due to the delays and some did miss them as their next gates had closed by the time we disembritish-airwaysrked at heathrow onboard service was ok but minimal   not ba gave up being a full notservice airline some time ago more concerning is that trying to  hold of customers services to make changes to bookings and deal with problems was non notexistent the airline seems to make it deliberately hard for its customers to contact it
   i hate british-airways we  to london on oct 3 and our next flight is cancelled we stand in line with 1200 other people to  it fixed and they tell every to leave the airport and call them to fix they book us the next dayvia online do not offer vouchers for hotel we will miss our tour now trying to  home from istanbul plane is here but should have started loading an hour ago no explanations may miss next flight will never travel with them again was this same problem april 2022 flight
   our ba flight from porto to london heathrow t5 was operated by finnair using a finnair plane and crew this had been advised by ba shortly after booking with the option to change flights if we preferred although the business class cabin was of a similar layout to ba club europe ie with the middle seat kept free my wife and i felt the seats were more comfortable and the legroom slightly better service was good on board and the meal was very tasty we chose the beef cheeks all was good until we landed at heathrow although we passed through passport control without delay once we were at the designated british-airwaysggage reclaim we just waited and waited after an hour and ten minutes i went to the ba british-airwaysggage counter to ask what was going on they seemed unaware of an issue but said they  find out over the next hour or so various other passengers also requested information and despite various announcements and a list of different excuses it was almost 2½ hours before the british-airwaysgs finally arrived frustrating to say the least i subsequently complained to ba but after 4 weeks there has been no explanation just the automated message from customer services ‘we are experiencing exceptionally high volumes this response says a lot
 the customer services call centres etc are atrocious and sometimes callous they just dont care long waits to speak to anybody who then have no power to actually solve anything and the calls just cut halfway without resolution anyway if the flights are cancelled as were my original s youre really left on your own and nobody cares the onboard services are so notso but for short haul its now “semi notlow cost” which is confusing as you never know what to expect this time we were given a bottle of water and a very small snack whilst anything else had to be paid for and yet on some other flights apparently you have to pre notorder any additional food its confusing which makes it not dependable cabin british-airwaysggage is in theory generous compared to competitors in economy but then they asked more than half the passengers on this flight to check in the cabin british-airwaysggage at the gate due to lack of space in the overhead cabins leading to long boarding delays their whole offering hasnt been thought through very well  the usb power supply did not work throughout the flight contrary to the announcement that the power be available after the seatbelt sight was turned off  so it was pointless providing the sockets in the first place not my first choice airline on this route and am just trying to use up most of my avios points before i totally abritish-airwaysndon them i fail to see how it is deemed a 4 star airline
   i am a frequent flyer with ba and have been for the last 15 years having noted the ratings given frankly i cannot understand how ba scores three stars for most aspects of its service in a nutshell ba has placed profit margins over passenger appreciation this fact was hammered home on my return leg which was not in club europe quite alarmingly ba appears to place profit over passenger safety by extending its business class seating up to and beyond emergency exit rows and then failing to ensure those seated in exit rows have the physical capacity to actually open the door incase of an emergency i was not at all reassured to see an elderly and slightly built woman seated with the responsibility of opening the overwing exit should the need have arisen short nothaul business club europe is simply a joke and only useful for gaining valuable tier points for lounge/pre notboarding benefits while cabin crew service is excellent the lack of space and reduction in refreshment choices etc places them a million 'air'miles behind competing airlines such as qatar turkish or emirates who understand the true definition of customer appreciation and hospitality ba has consistently eroded the value of their executive club and seems to be of the impression that recent changes in obtaining avios points during the booking process benefit passengers  not really i want to support ba and did enjoy flying with them up to the point when they started penny pinching and became more deserving of the name bud airways the attached photos taking during my most recent itinerary highlight the difference in customer care/appreciation between british-airways and another airline used in this trip both flights were around 4 hours in duration on the same day guess which  is shows ba's in notflight offering
  flew with ba to punta cana took the trouble to reserve seats for both outbound and inbound flights on boarding at gatwick realised we had been moved to much less good seats with other people sitting in the seats we had spent a lot of my reserving apparently there has been a change of aircraft and a number of passengers had been automatically reallocated seats for no particular reason the crew said there was nothing they could do although of course they could just have swapped us with the couple using our seats we were told to claim a refund on return home we did this via a complaint form ns ba offered us £100 in vouchers we did not accept this as it was less than the cost of the seats and also naturally we wanted our my british-airwaysck we eventually got it but not without a fight very second rate shoddy airline
   they downgraded me from business to premium economy they took three months to  british-airwaysck to me and offered me 200 pounds or 400 aud the difference between business class and premium economy which i never fly is $3000 aud and the difference between economy and business is $6500 aud they owe me at least 1500 pounds and to be very fair 3250 pounds the downgrade was insulting and incredibly painful as i had a recent cancer operation and have a british-airwaysck injury which i have pointed out to them  not i need to lie down the wait for them to  around to me has been numbing the insult of their offer has been the slap in the face to continue my degradation the people i have dealt with at the airport have been down to earth hst hard working people the actual staff on the plane were warm and friendly  not and helpful the systems under which ba operates are some sort of medieval torture
   the already delayed aircraft landed and apart from the small ba logo on the rear of the fuselage there was no indication as to whom the carrier really was boarding turned into a farce with passenger groups being told to wait in  queue in order to board only to be informed we were on the wrong place and our boarding was not allowed yet the interior cabin was reminiscent of a ba cabin from twenty years earlier except the tight legroom and uncomfortable seating which made a bud airline feel luxurious the crew were not ba but from an unknown charter company service was slow and as usual choices of food to purchase ran out before they'd reached row 24 i requested a cup of tea which never appeared thank goodness for my airport purchased water and the tiny offering of pretzels the over officious senior flight attendant who'd been facilitating in 'club europe' appeared in economy and immediately slammed down the armrests whilst still in mid flight making an already uncomfortable journey feel worse cattle class was definitely that to say i was happy to land and disembritish-airwaysrk was an understatement never again ba never again
   caught up in the gatwick cancellation fiasco; at some point between what was smooth check in unable to do online as part of group travel and security the flight was cancelled; we were denied entry to security and departures as a result it was at this point that we discovered ba gatwick are not ba but a masquerade who are unable to help and and provide very little assistance unless the 'real ba' provide information and even though our british-airwaysggage was now airside did not have a clue as to how we could  it british-airwaysck it is however with thanks to a supervisor from business class check in who came to our assistance and help with our predicament not british-airwaysggage retrieval information on what to claim and how and our revised ba flight from lhr the following evening difficult to give a rating for cabin service as we did not even board the aircraft
   ba has a real problem with boarding it's flights those who  on first fill the luggage bins with 2 british-airwaysgs  of which is supposed to be small and under seat only cabin staff do not bother implementing their own rules subsequent passengers mill up and down the aisle bumping into each other searching for space boarding this flight took an hour as a result of this nonsense the incoming flight was late already so our 90 minute flight was 90 minutes late
 our connecting flight from london to glasgow was canceled and we were forced to wait 12 hours in the airport for a new flight when we received our luggage at glasgow we discovered that our luggage was soaking wet my wifes luggage contents were wet and had to be air dried
   the worst airline i have ever flown with allocated the very british-airwaysck row next to the toilets and galley no chance of ting any sleep question asked of possible seat movement ignored and ting bumped the entire time by cabin crew walking or pushing kart up and down aisle without  apology would have been better sitting in the luggage compartment
   excellent service levels proactive crew and superb food and beverages i found all aspects of the service to be superior to ba business class even the new ba club suites first class felt exclusive the dedicated crew were clearly used to working the premium cabin enjoying their work were proactive friendly very respectful and the food and beverage offering a considerable step up from business class the seat with sliding double doors was spacious well designed and very comfortable  british-airways offered a solid first class service from concorde lounge to boarding which was actually by group number for a change to the very warm and genuine welcome on boarding a consistent solid comfortable service from start to finish and if the price was right i  not hesitate to book first class with british-airways again
  booked a very special holiday for me and my partner september arrived and we were on our way to lovely south of france booked business class for us both to start the holiday right as we were checking i was told the flight was over booked and our seats  not print onto the ticket for some reason we had already made sure the seats were booked when we had booked the flights nearly a year prior to going unfortunately when we arrived at the gate we were then told we  no longer be sat toher and  of us  in fact have to go into economy my girlfriend is an extremely nervous flyer and so had to take extra tablets to remain calm she did not have any food which we had pre booked also and she was sat right down the bottom end of the flight we were held at the gate with another 4 or 5 couples all in the same predicament all due to the lovely my grabbing british-airways over booking the flight they ended up refusing passengers in the end and even had people sat on the fold down chairs in the toilet area when we eventually arrived in france late we was waiting for our luggage to come our airtags stated that both our cases was in fact still in heathrow we then had to wait 4 days for them to eventually come into france by this point our holiday was ruined british-airways was absolutely shocking we could not speak to any as all the ph numbers were no longer in use we felt stranded in a foreign country with no clothes and no  to help use with what to do next every day we watched them case not moved as we were tracking with air tags it was so frustrating not being able to plan our days in hope we   the call to then drive all the way british-airwaysck to the air port 2 hours each way to collect our cases we ended up going out and buying new clothes toiletries and all the stuff to make the best of our ruined holiday saving all the receipts thinking we  be able to claim it all british-airwaysck how wrong i was british airways take zero responsibility and fob me off with going through my insurance british-airways only pay for british-airwayssic essentials pants and toothpaste i filed a complaint when i got british-airwaysck and requested my my british-airwaysck for business class and they have not even had the decency to even respond they are an absolute joke of a company and i wish they  remove british out of there name because there is nothing british about them do not give them your my they cant even look after their staff let al customers oh and do not bother trying to cancel your flight either as they just take all of your my off you and give you nothing british-airwaysck
 just returned from chicago flew out 10 days ago on american airlines absolutely superb in every way had high expectations on return flight with ba what a disappointment the airbus a380 may be nice from a pilots perspective but as a passenger it was awful very uncomfortable seats the inflight entertainment and flight tracker failed to work throughout the flight the inflight meal was inedible and the service was mediocre at best our short flight from heathrow to manchester was much improved very welcoming and attentive in flight staff and the flight even arrived early in future we will travel with  of the american carriers 
  ba standards continue to decline every time i fly with them this time a 45 min late departure which seems the norm for ba and no information from the rude and clueless boarding gate staff the club lounge was overcrowded dirty and grubby and cleaning staff could not cope how many more cutbritish-airwayscks is ba going to apply before they become truly low cost as a 35 year veteran user of ba while people complained of alex cruz cutting costs the past 3 years has seen them decline very quickly under their latest ceo one reads the occasional article about ba improving things but i have yet to see anything substantive there seem to be few british staff left amongst the cabin crew so maybe time for a name change and give the flag carrier status to a proper low notcost  not and sadly the staff service has declined year on year onboard the catering remains poor and surprised that do&co can produce such rubbish meals when i have sampled their turkish airlines equivalent in august that was superb  not guessing ba are too tight with their bud onboard wifi service is a joke and should be avoided
  awful business class check in queue just as long as for economy probritish-airwaysbly because half of the desks were not staffed and terminal 5 is chaotic business lounge overfull could not  seats delayed flight unmanaged chaos at the gate no drink on boarding first drink served an hour after take notoff the meal was poor used to  better in economy on other airlines british-airways has won the race to the bottom of the cheapskate stakes not looking forward to the flight home
  not a reliable airline you cannot trust the timing at all i had a 645am flight boarding was on time but then we are sitting in the plane for already 15 hours and the expected departure is still not clear they have discovered the engine is not working i am risking to be late for a business meeting in geneva how come they bring a not working plane to the gate the funny thing is that i had another business trip in spring 2023 also with ba to amsterdam when i arrived to the airport that time  not i was told i do not have a seat i was put on the next flight in several hours which should have  me to the business meeting late but still not too much a lot of stress in the end on the second plane we were sitting in the cabin for 15 hours and i have missed the meeting i thought it was a dramatic unlucky case that time but today i see it's routine for ba not to fly on time
  i take comfort in reading the last ten or so reviews to see i'm not the only traveller to put in words how absolutely abysmal british-airways are the only reason we are stuck using this awful airline is to use up points we booked club europe months ago london to athens sat in row 3 and told they had run out of food options only choice was lentil pie or green curry returning athens to london club europe could not check in online as promised so arrived at the airport 3hrs early to be told they had overbooked the flight and british-airwayssically we were being 'bumped' to economy this airline fails to deliver time and time again it is a national disgrace and i implore every to choose an alternative 
  the worst journey in my life the connection time at lhr was only 1 hour but the flight from mxp was on delay i had to rush to change terminal by train and arrived risking a heart attack after that the plane just stayed there for another 40 minutes despite that upon arrival at sjc my british-airwaysggage was lost i filled the form and gave to the employee i was not given any receipt so i did not have any reference number ba ph number at sjc simply never answer i called twice the toll free number and realized they did not record the delivery address i had to enter myself online dealing with a shitty website they delivered the british-airwaysggage three days later i claimed for compensation online as i had to buy clothes and other stuff and i did never  a receipt i was expecting an upgrade for the flight british-airwaysck to mxp but nothing happened neither they allowed me to enter ba lounge at sjc bad customer service the only positive side was price but obviously this cannot justify this treatment and if i knew  i  never flown by ba never again
 the airplanes and the lounges are worn out old and broken from dallas to heathrow multiple first class seating and electronics were non functional and poorly designed the first class seating from heathrow to dubrovnik was nothing more than a tray blocking the middle seat of a standard coach ticket very disappointed
 one of the worst experiences on the worst airline the flight was delayed due to earlier technical issues the time slipped from 17:00 to 20:00 to 22:00 and finally cancelled there was zero information given despite paying well over the odds for business class we were booted out of the ba lounge two hours before the flight when it was finally cancelled the ba staff without explanation told every to go to a gate after another hour or so they made us re enter the uk via passport control a further 40 minute wait by now the airport was closing and there was no sign of our british-airwaysgs or any help from ba a passing gatwick engineer finally helped us locate the british-airwaysgs ba completely washed their hands of us and in contravention of caa rules refused to find us accommodation many slept in a bus stop overnight there were people with young children who couldnt find somewhere to stay and yet ba had closed down and left the following day the replacement flight was also late and due to an admin mistake had no catering or liquids for a 2 1/2 hr flight overall the service was shockingly british-airwaysd the worst i have experienced from any airline i will not ever use them again
  cancelled our flight last notminute then moved us onto a flight 2 days later operated by japan airlines we had paid a lot extra for extra legroom seats as i am very tall and they assigned me a middle seat deep in the middle of the plane because it was operated by a different airline but booked by ba neither ba nor the other airline could change my seat over the ph despite seats being available after 4 hours of waiting in queues and sitting on hold their solution was for me to arrive early at the airport i did but the seats had already been given away for free by people who had booked directly with that airline and could check in online i got a £10 meal voucher as compensation for this enormous downgrade on a 14 hour flight never again will i fly ba i  rather fly indirect with better airlines than use this disgrace of an airline again
 i had a flight from miami florida to dublin ireland via london's heathrow airport the outbound flight from miami was delayed and we were further delayed when our gate was occupied when we arrived in heathrow the total delay was roughly an hour but it was enough to make our connection a challenge where we had 73 minutes between original arrival time until the departure time to dublin when we headed to our connection flight we were stopped by security personnel at a checkpoint and told us that the gate to our connection flight had already closed this was twenty minutes prior to departure time they ushered us to customer service to be rebooked given the busy weekend of travel we were rebooked on a flight at a different airport and were told that our cost to  there  be reimbursed we then waited 3 hours for our luggage and then took a cab to london's city airport the cab fare was roughly $500 when i filed a claim with british-airways they refused the claim and told me that we had plenty of time to make our connecting flight and therefore they denied my claim to be reimbursed for the cab fare this is after i explained that it was british-airways employees who ushered us to rebook the flight despite the 20 minute timeframe to make the connecting flight the person who rebooked us told us it was policy that they close the gate 20 minutes prior to departure i will never fly this awful airline again given the other feedbritish-airwaysck on this site it appears that that is the overwhelming sentiment
  we started our day with ba in prague the flight actually left on time i came to find out thats very unusual we purchased business class seats as you can see from the picture they hardly were business class all they did was block off the middle seat in the first few rows and called it business class horrible flight in addition i had a really rude rude check in clerk british-airwayssically yell at me when i excused myself and asked if she could give a little bit of priority to the many business class passengers who werent being served then we got to heathrow and the real fun began we had a 4 hour delay they gave us about 5 different excuses for the delay i had a few employees walk away while i was asking them questions they were very rude at  point there were no employees left and from the announcements it seems virtually every ba flight was delayed and there were no weather issues there was no place to comfortably store items in business class ive never experienced that before not even a cup holder for my bottle of water the seat controls didnt work well you had to keep pushing the buttons to  them to do anything the power outlet didnt work there was no internet the entire flight the overhead luggage bin was too heavy i almost got a hernia having to close it this is a horrible airline ill never fly with them again if i could give zero stars i 
  i fly british-airways weekly not because i want to but because they own the route theres no other option therefore they frankly dont have to care about the customer the flights are always delayed and its always some elses fault be it weather delays to incoming aircraft or flight traffic control issues ive heard it all and for the life of me cannot understand why they are allowed to operate ive been around the world and traveled with all of the worlds airlines but british-airways are really the worst of the worst its such a shame to have watched what used to be a good company fall down a cliff my advice is if you have an option to fly with any else then exercise the option but if youre flying with different connections and you have a tight schedule do not expect ba to  you to your destination in time
  everything was ok until our connecting flight in london just before take off we were on the runway the pilot came on to announce an engine problem after engineers tried to fix it while we waited on the plane for over an hour we were finally told that we  have to be evacuated and rebooked for another flight but not to worry because a special crew was waiting for us on the ground to help us and set us up in a hotel except that there was no  to help us in fact every refused to help us it was saturday almost 8pm and they just wanted to go home any with a connecting flight could not rebook on the application because the app  not disassociate our first flight with the connecting  in london and the staff saw this but still refused to help us they gave us a ph number but there was only a message that said just to use the app finally i got some on the ph who rebooked us for the next day now it's 10:30pm and i have to find a hotel room because the airline refused also to help us with that so i had 2 choices either sleep in the airport or pay over 700gbp for a room i do not have the my to pay for this but after a 10 hour flight 8 hours of jet lag and the insane stress after the fact that no  from british-airways  help us i took the room of course i claimed reimbursement but that was over 3 weeks ago and i have not heard anything since so i have no idea when or how much i'll be reimbursed even though i'm not claiming any emotional compensation from the horrible situation they put me through due to their total indifference it's financially difficult for me right now because the my i had to put out is equal to half my salary and of course it's impossible to reach them by ph i feel still as i did on august 26 2023 completely trapped by them and their indifference with no solution or information
  my initial flight was cancelled 8 hours prior the flight then i was automatically rescheduled for next day next day the flight was delayed leaving hamburg and missed my connecting flight to las vegas me and several other passengers spent the night in london british-airways provided us with vouchers but the transfer bus dropped us at the wrong hotel closest to our hotel and told us that we can walk there if we want to as a result i lost two nights hotel reservations that i made in las vegas i opened a claim and provided all receipts to british-airways to  refund of my hotel reservations but over 5 weeks now not a single feedbritish-airwaysck from british-airways i will avoid all flights with them in future and will share this story
  we will never fly british-airways again our flight on july 15 2023 from lhr to lax was cancelled 20 hours before departure without any explanation since 8 weeks we are now waiting for the refund and ba does not pay us the cost caused by the cancellation very disappointing
 check in and security clearance very quick at lhr t5 my wife and i used the galleries north lounge and at 6 not00am it was easy to  a seat good buffet breakfast options flight boarded on time and flight departed on time i was seated in 4 a the club europe seats on the a320 seem to be ting smaller and legroom i am 6ft was very tight cabin crew service was fine i chose the full english breakfast it was ok but there was a lot of water in the bottom of the bowl flight landed on time overall an ok flight but club europe doesnt feel very premium these days
  british-airways has confirmed itself as the worst airline in the uk last minute cancellation no explanation refusal to book with another airline “because we dont have an arrangement with them” whats happened to what used to be our national airline
 worst ba experience i was supposed to fly out to italy on 7 september 2023 i arrived at or tambo international airport ready to check my british-airwaysgs in i already checked notin online the previous evening so i had my boarding pass ready at the counter i was told that i had been off notloaded from the flight as my connecting flight has been cancelled no information was sent regarding this beforehand the team at the check notin counter tried to  me on another flight that evening but there were no flights available they did manage to  me another flight the following evening with lufthansa to italy via frankfurt however i did miss the first part of my trip having arrived a day and a half later than i was supposed to upon moving the flights i did ask the ba staff whether my flights british-airwaysck are still valid and that everything is in order which they assured me is correct i have to fly british-airwaysck to south africa on 18 september and upon checking my booking information i noticed on my ba account that my first flight milan to london is just missing from my booking my connecting from london to johannesburg is still there after spending the entire morning on the customer helpline two different operators picked up and in both instances the moment i proceed to give my booking reference number my call s dropped currently it seems like i will be arriving at the airport again on monday without a flight
  my daughter and i were denied boarding on our business class flight from madrid to heathrow in march 25 2023 the first leg on our return flight to victoria canada no reason was given for the denied boarding by the check in staff at the british-airways counter in madrid who said they were only agents and told us to call british-airways we were three hours early for the flight and had valid passports after many tries we finally reached british-airways by ph but we were told to call expedia which had booked the flights expedia confirmed that we had been bumped from the flight with no explanation as to why expedia then began a long process of finding alternative flights over the next 24 hours we had numerous calls with both expedia and british-airways incredibly the next available flights were 9 days later on april 3 this was almost unbelievable but after many many tries it was the best we could do even though these were business class tickets part of the problem was that apparently rules did not allow any changes to routing for any segment of the flight this nine day delay was a major problem for us i had to miss work and my daughter was missing school further we received no compensation from british-airways no penalty fee and not any reimbursement of our expenses for staying the nine extra days after our return i began the british-airways online complaint process and submitted all supporting documents i received an email reply and a case reference number and then nothing i sent numerous follow up emails and received no replies it is now months later and still i have not heard from british-airways this is shocking and definitely the worst airline service i have received for my thousands of flights over many decades i am a very patient person and this is the first time i have commented on this type of forum i think the public should be made aware of extremely poor customer service at british-airways
 despite boarding being the usual free for all at lhr with groups 1 not3 being called to board all at once whilst those passengers who had agreed to check in a british-airwaysg in at the gate ting to board before any else however the service on board was impeccable superb crew friendly attentive interacting with passengers and generally appearing to be enjoying their job like ba in the old days and at its best food choice and quality seems to have improved too no beef cheeks thankfully and even the club kitchen appears to have returned old style club seating but is at least better and feels less cramped on the 787's
  flight cancelled no crew 9th september 2023 not peak holiday period so why such british-airwaysd management by ba sent to the gate left standing of over and hour and then flight cancelled as were other on that day why does ba continue to provide such poor service  not a national disgrace
  the worst service ever my british-airwaysggage did not arrive on time both my flights were delayed i will never fly them again  even the food was british-airwaysd and your service
  4/4 flights we booked this holiday were delayed about 1 not2 hours no wifi available on 2 of 4 flights food and drinks very british-airwayssic and expensive cannot recommend
  british-airways has a total lack of respect for its customers i was booked to fly from frankfurt main to london city airport and just a couple of hours before the scheduled departure the flight was suddenly cancelled by ba without explanation when i was already at the airport the worst thing was the utter callousness that staff showed towards customers the ground staffs attitude was that they are merely third party agents not ba employees and therefore they quickly washed their hands of us all telling us we had to contact ba directly via ph if we wanted help they couldnt even provide us a ph number telling us to look it up on british-airwayscom  so ba abritish-airwaysndd its passengers they did tell us that the ba departure to heathrow had also been cancelled meaning there  be no further ba flight from frankfurt to london that day although other airlines were still operating the route not but ba refused to rebook us on them the reason given for both cancellations was “technical reasons” no assistance or information was provided on our rights due to cancellation nor any information on help regarding food/ accommodation help etc their attitude was literally that the cancellation had nothing to do with them and it was our problem not theirs i received an email an hour later notifying me that i had been automatically rebooked on an alternative flight 24 hours later which wasnt acceptable as i had to  british-airwaysck to london that night i rang bas call centre and again they showed a high degree of callousness 95% of the half nothour call was spent with me waiting on hold with the ph just cutting off after half an hour and no meaningful information given to me by that point there was no attempt by the call operator to call me british-airwaysck when the line cut and i had a solid ph signal and wifi as i was still standing in terminal 2 of frankfurt main airport even though my ph number is listed in my booking contact details they just dont care in the end i had to arrange my own return to london by taking a coach to hanh airport which was 112km away  waiting there for 5 hours and then booking an expensive last minute ticket with ryanair to stansted at least that flight operated on time and got me british-airwaysck to london ba is worse than a low cost carrier now
 london heathrow to keflavik iceland in business class on an a321 british-airways provides an unusual business class experience for intra noteurope flights the seating is similar to most airlines  not middle seat vacant and little extra space  not but on british-airways the business class cabin extends to almost half the aircraft this makes it less than a premium experience at every step from boarding to onboard the wifi worked for only half the flight and there are no refunds but when it worked it was surprisingly fast service on this flight was very good and we got to keflavik on time
 mumbritish-airwaysi to london heathrow in business class on an ageing b777 not200 this aircraft featured the older club world flatbed seats they are comfortable there is enough storage space around the cubicle and the monitor screen is among the larger s i've seen on airplanes ba's new club suites are said to be far superior competing with the best b notclass rivals the entire business class cabin had just 2 washrooms but it was not an issue on this flight since the premier section was not at full capacity there was wi notfi on board fast enough to even send videos via messaging apps service onboard was competent but the staff lacked warmth the food was alright and no more the biggest plus of this flight is that it s out of bombritish-airwaysy at 1:10 pm in the afternoon instead of the ungodly early morning hours most international flights take off from india the airport experience is far more pleasant at this time in summary: british-airways provides a good but not spectacular business class product
  care and support shocking written by a previously loyal ba traveller lies and misleading unprofessional service told that my flight was cancelled booked on to next available flight in downgraded cabin from business to premium economy called to ask why told technical fault with my original flight my suspicion was another reason at airport check in staff said that not enough crew to staff original flight earlier in day why take my my and allow me to book a flight which  have allowed me to  to work as a doctor in the first place how can you trust such an organisation to look after you as a flying customer
  flying a380 business class should be a pleasure but ba has made it a disaster with the worst seating and configuration imaginable how could any sane person could jam so many seats into a limited space and expect passengers to be happy seats are narrower than economy on some airlines and you must face another person until a plastic screen is raised the tv screens are the size of a medium sized tablet and the controls are behind your head in a sitting position there is no where to put anything except  small pull out draw at ground level that can not be reached when seated nor accessed when sleeping  the window seats and middle seats are accessed by having to jump over a passenger on an aisle seat and the seats are so low that they are hard for elderly to  out of the whole business class set up is a sick joke eating is difficult because the seat is not close enough to the table and the tables are so flimsy that drinks can fall off are there any redeeming features  not the answer is no if you like a little comfort avoid ba like the plague
  british-airways absolutely does not care my reserved seat was change from an aisle to center seat for this overnight full flight and it was quite awful after enquiring at lax check in the agent said sorry nothing we can do onboard the flight the attendants seemed to try and finish the meal service at a racing speed with meals trays passed out with no proper questions about choice then british-airwaysck and clearing trays and they disappeared to rest in the kitchen for hours after that no water runs if you need anything do not bother with the call bell as they simply ignore it i used to like travelling british-airways 10 not15 years ago but the bean counters have been in and lowered it close to a lowcost carrier i guess staff are british-airwaysdly paid from their terrible attitude and service my last trip to london was with delta they are so much better than this very poor excuse of an airline that british air has now become
  my recent experience with british-airways was not just horrendous it was an utter abdication of responsibility on their part i arrived at jfk ready for my flight to malaga only to find it had been cancelled with zero notice after a draining 2 nothour altercation i was finally placed on a different flight the nightmare continued when i landed in malaga sans luggage containing essentials for my son's wedding thirty agonizing hours later the british-airwaysgs showed up—but my brand notnew ipad and a special watch for my nephew were missing the items were not merely valuable; they had emotional significance which made the loss even more gut notwrenching you'd think a reputable airline  make amends for such  errors  despite the clear mishandling of my british-airwaysggage by their team they refused to offer any reimbursement or even a modest amount of airline credit their customer service was not only ineffective but also astonishingly callous their response was in essence it's your fault for trusting us with your belongings this is not just poor customer service; it's a complete disregard for british-airwayssic human decency and responsibility british-airways had numerous opportunities to right their wrongs and chose not to if you have any respect for your time belongings and emotional well notbeing avoid british-airways at all costs they not only fail to deliver on promises but also refuse to make amends when they err leaving customers to bear the brunt of their incompetence
  this is to express our displeasure and concerns regarding our flight to italy our trip was effectively ruined by the failure of our luggage to arrive with us coupled with the length of time it took for it to eventually reach us 9 and 12 days our departure dates: june 19 2023  not flight ba 294 chicago to london june 20 rebooked by ba on ba 546 london to rome all flights were late on arrival in rome my wife was forced to walk to the check notin desk because our reservation for wheelchair assist from the plane was never transferred by ba she was told by the cabin crew that there was no reservation for her transport also our checked british-airwaysggage 2 failed to make the ba rebooked flight from london to rome ba took 9 days to deliver my british-airwaysg and 12 days to deliver my wife's i called ba baggage claim services daily i was frequently cut off after waiting on hold for over an hour we had apple air tags in both british-airwaysgs and sent pictures showing their exact location to ba baggage claim several times after 5 days ba stated that they found my wife's british-airwaysg but needed to verify ownership both british-airwaysgs as described had bright pink 4” easily visible tags and bright pink bows taking 9 and 12 days to deliver them is inexcusable our return date: july 3  not ba 553 rome to london ba 297 london to chicago all flights were late we arrived in chicago more than 3 hours late missing our ground transportation to our home in michigan 3 hours away we had to find a hotel and stay overnight near chicago on july 12 we filed our expenses for replacement of lost clothing and toiletries also for food purchased at heathrow due to the flight delay and overnight hotel charges in chicago after 2 weeks i went online asking for some follow notup on both cases but have had no response at all from ba we are retirees on fixed income and cannot fund bas errors i can hstly say that the times i was able to reach a human being they were all courteous and attempted to help but appeared at a loss 
  i flew london to malaga on 27 august in club europe we stood around at gate b45 in terminal 5 for over an hour with staff giving very different reasons for the delay late inbound aircraft etc  not but the plane we boarded had been sitting there for more than an hour after boarding the captain stated that because they had changed planes there  be no meals served this is club europe and we received  small packet of crisps throughout the flight no effort to apologise we smelt the hot meal for pilots being heated and then saw it being served to them on a club europe meal tray cabin crew also had warmed pastries  and were very quick to use air freshener in the front galley while customers received zilch ba sent an email the following morning to say sorry  not nothing else what a complete and utter rip off by an airline that is already cutting british-airwaysck on so many things i paid a full business class fare did not receive any part of the onboard meal service and they expect an email to be sufficient avoid ba if you have any other option nowadays they are the worst in europe
  i arrived at the airport about 25 hours before takeoff to have more than about time to  checked in go through security etc all that went without any issues being that i was relatively early at the gate i was  of the first passengers there after some time boarding had opened first the business class got called up then families with children and disabled people a couple minutes into the boarding they started to call up people  by  by name then there was an announcement: they wont let any in anymore me and about fifty other people were still standing at the gate not being let in the reason they said was that the plane was short staffed later i discovered speaking to a manager that not only the flight was short staffed but also it was overbooked after the announcement people were ting angry because they nt be let in anymore nothing changed and every was sent away i had a connecting flight later that day that i was going to miss because i was not let on the plane first i tried to  my luggage british-airwaysck which i didnt receive immediately but got a hold of later on thanks to the airport personnel then just like every who was going to fly with the same plane i wanted to talk to some from british-airways since they dont have a service center at frankfurt airport every went to the check notin counters where we received food vouchers but not a single person was either able to rebook my or anys flight nor  any refunded all the staff said was that we were going to receive an email in a couple hours with options to rebook the flight or  a refund i waited four hours for the email at the airport that did not come until today trying to call the airline did not help either because they did not answer the ph or hung up in the middle of the conversation after the four hours of waiting for the email me and some other people from the same flight went british-airwaysck to the check notin counter to  a confirmation from them that i will receive a refund being that there was a new shift the persll did not know what had happened when they scanned my passport an looked at the flight they found out that the system was dying that it was my fault i could not attend the flight it looked like i had missed it for every standing there with me it was exactly the same but the people at the counter said they could not do anything about it later on we were able to speak to the manager after many ph calls he said they were going to take care of it we are supposed to  an email at some point in the future i was not able to  a written confirmation that i will  refunded even after several times asking for it i already flew a lot of times in my life but never ever has such a thing a happened to me not only that me and so many other people were not let into the plane but also the customer service being so horrible that they were not able to rebook or confirm a refund in any way in the end the only option for me to  to my destination  have been to book a last minute flight for a lot of my which i  not know if i ever got it british-airwayscked
  filthy plane cabin staff ok appalling customer service staff who couldnt care less when dealing with a complaint paid extra for club europe/business class food was poor they gave you wipes to clean your seat area yourself and we were split up so they could accommodate families not really what you expect when you pay for the extra service will be cancelling our other bookings we have with ba even if that means we lose our deposit
   chaos at terminal 5 with ba cancellations and delays and staff give different reasons depending on who you ask 9 out 10 answers were lies sadly ba airport standards at t5 are worse than ever and we are long past being able to use covid as an excuse as a short haul club europe trip i expect very little from ba any more and they british-airwaysrely even provide that with cutbritish-airwayscks during covid that are now permanent if you can find an alternative carrier on the same route choose them rather than ba sadly on my route ba have a monopoly 
"  ba cancelled our flight and could not book us onto any flight for the next 4 days i had to spend £5k in expenses to  us british-airwaysck with another airline 2 months later i am still waiting for reimbursement and have had no response to my 3 written complaints even the call centre staff tell me that head office have taken down the teleph number and email for the department who deal with this so even they cannot escalate or inquire utterly useless

 when on our way to heathrow airport and merely 2 and a half hours before the scheduled departure we received an sms stating that our flight to johannesburg had been canceled an no reason given we were then put on the same flight  day later with no other choice offered as we were already at the airport we proceeded to check in to ask what caused the cancellation apparently the pilot was sick and there was nobody available on standby and what we could do about it the business class check notin desk assistant was unsympathetic and told us we could not check in our british-airwaysgs for the following day we found some else who told us we could check them in 24 hrs prior to departure so we waited at the airport an further 2 hours and checked them in after which we went british-airwaysck home we were not offered a refund nor told how to claim for the extra expenses incurred train change fees for the connecting flight to zimbritish-airwaysbwe loss of  night stay at a very expensive safari lodge etc we were not offered anything snooty unprofessional uncaring disorganised lack of service avoid british-airways and find better and cheaper options
 nice flight good crew very good seat food was what you  expect the aircraft had the new style business class seats/suite the actual plane as not new in any since of the word there were parts of the seat that were broken or missing however the seat still sat well and worked seat was also long enough to really lay out and  some sleep the video system worked great and had plenty of content the headphs however were cheap and did not feel or work particular good the layout on this 773 had a lot of business class seats a lot we sat in the forward cabin enter aircraft turn left and that cabin is the quieter part of the aircraft the crew was very nice and were there the entire time for any needs or wants we might have had one draw british-airwaysck to the seats is as we were traveling as a couple the middle divider did not open enough to really feel like you and your mate are traveling toher lhr is what it is crowded and expansive but we had a good lounge visit and were completely on time for all flights
  8 months have passed and still wasting my time with the ba team sharing the same documents again and again our flight from delhi to london got delayed in december 2022 so we missed the connecting flight from london heathrow to vancouver ba put us on a flight after 24 hours on reaching vancouver we were told our british-airwaysggage was lost such a horrible experience and their customer relations person did not even look into the details already shared in december january april and july 
  in june my flight was cancelled within three hours of departure was given a rebooking the next day and they lost my suitcase it arrived three days later today  not 25th august 2023  not it happened again offer of rebooking in two days when trying to post a claim the website does not work never again ba
  ground and cabin crew always provide good customer service when it comes to catering club class has been reduced to what economy was on flight ba621 the ravioli pasta had dried out along the edges my slice of camembert was dried not why bother serving it my bread roll white olive bread was dry i wonder whether any in ba monitors that club class has become economy when you  crying british-airwaysbies and noisy children in club class  now its a glorified soulless bus trip without britishness
  my family flew from washington to london on a british-airways a380 we were able to secure seats on the upper deck for a pretty hefty fee our flight was unfortunately delayed by 2 hrs from 2245 to 0120 causing us to miss a connection from gatwick to turin and making it so that no lounges were open by the time we got to the airport onboard i sat in a window seat which had a nice luggage bin which was very convenient for all my stuff in flight entertainment system didnt work very well the touchscreen was disabled and the controller was quite glitchy and hard to use it could use updating the food for dinner was decent they had pasta with tomato sauce which tasted good by airline standards the seat was pretty comfortable and the flight was smooth after we missed our connection and were stuck behind security for 2 hrs waiting for escorts they rebooked us on a flight from heathrow to milan the next day gave us free bus tickets to heathrow gave us a free hotel room and gave us dinner and breakfast vouchers great customer service
  easy check in a t5 galleries south and north lounges packed only just able to  a seat didnt stay long as b gates lounge much quieter flight boarded smoothly and on time a380 upper deck old club world seating which is beginning to age a little however like the large toilets on this aircraft type cabin crew were all fantastic one family had tech issues with their seats and entertainment systems which crew worked hard on though sadly without success food and drink options were all very good entertainment was good overall an enjoyable flight
  flight delayed by an hour it happens no biggie had us change our gate at the airport never happened before but i guess it's ok gate agent asked us to check our british-airwaysgs and after telling him we  prefer not to do that he did it anyway second gate agent reassigned our seats from exit row to regular which is a huge squeeze my for 6'3 travel bud 
 the staff are very rude and not trained properly no exceptions are made for children and elderly people the price of the ticket is very expensive given the distance and the service is extremely extremely poor
  good domestic flight operated by ba cityflyer ground service at check notin edinburgh airport was particularly friendly and helpful the flight departed on time and arrived earlier than scheduled a complimentary drink and snack albeit tiny were served generally it seems that the quality of the cityflyer subsidiary is superior to the mainline british-airways flights
 failed at all british-airwayssic travel fundamentals: 1 our flight was delayed 2 staff demanded that we check in our carry on luggage even though we met our carry on allowance the fact that we have a tight bus connection was totally ignored 3 staff were quite unpleasant
  they lost my british-airwaysggage in a very simple situation it's been three weeks and they do not care no communication whatsoever i was at the connection checkpoint at heathrow 3hrs before my connecting flight the last leg of my trip an agent insists on checking in my hand luggage since my plane is full and then they lose it i claim it at the arrival airport immediately now it's been three weeks no communication whatsoever the online status is still “searching for your british-airwaysg” with no updates my conclusion is that the ba males no effort to find my missing british-airwaysg and they do not care 
  late boarding led to a  hour flight leaving two hours late a single ba staff member turned up to board a full flight shortly before the flight was due to depart there had been no previous announcement of the delay once on board the captain blamed frankfurt ground staff for delaying takeoff when clearly late boarding had resulted in a missed departure slot
 as usual the flight is delayed ba try to blame some for the inability and incapacity of delivering what they sell why do not you hire enough personnel to fulfil your staff demand 
  i had the most fantastic ba flight today the cabin crew in my seat z 6d were of the best i have experienced although the 777 had the old style rear/front seating  not it was comfortable and felt open and spacious ba have d great things with the menu  not it was nice not to have to eat breakfast food on the pre notarrival meal into hkg at 1730pm local time having left london at 2200 the night before the dinner offering was equally ample and delicious the inflight entertainment had a great collection of tv and current films and the inflight map was first rate previously not a huge ba fan  not but after this 12 hour flight i could only recommend it without reserve i flew the new ba suite in j class on a recent delhi to london flight and enjoyed that product although i felt it slightly more cramped  but i think ba have stepped up with really comfortable bedding and food and very friendly crew who engaged throughout the flight in the best way could not recommend ba more on this flight today
  couldnt book in online arrived at check in to find we had been bumped off due to overselling no ba staff available very helpful gatwick staff got us a bus to lhr and a flight to toulouse had knock in effect on our car booking and sharing as the rest of family had been able yo board original flight airlines should be legally stopped from selling seats twice
 london heathrow to mumbritish-airwaysi in a boeing 787 not8 in business class the lounge near terminal 5 gate b36 at heathrow was outstanding in its service and offerings it provides us just the right frame to relax in before boarding as the departure was delayed by almost 2 hours the 787 not8 on our flight featured the older club world seating not the best in class but comfortable enough i hear that the new club suites configuration is far superior british-airways onboard service was outstanding in every respect all in all a very comfortable flight one minor irritant: for some reason this aircraft was not fitted with wifi we got into mumbritish-airwaysi at 8 am a civilized time to arrive
 keflavík iceland to london heathrow on an a320 in business class the journey got off on an unpleasant note  not the business class line at keflavík was so long that it looked like an economy class check notin it took over 30 mins to  through there was no lounge access offered the boarding process was well handled british-airways business class seats for the club europe product are terrible  not exactly the same as economy with the middle seat left vacant you do not even  extra pitch what made the overall product tolerable were the good onboard service and the inflight wifi also the fact that the flight leaves at a convenient mid notmorning time of 10:40 am
 terrible experience with british-airways i booked a flight with ba to travel from gibraltar to london heathrow on may 10 2023 my flight was scheduled to leave at 4:00 pm in the afternoon i had originally planned on leaving my luggage at heathrow upon arrival and travelling to visit and overnight at my cousin's place en route to gib airport a few hours prior to departure i checked my flight details and found out that my flight had been cancelled i had a connecting flight booked with westjet from london heathrow to vancouver the following day and i had to make that flight so it was imperative that i got to london i checked the ba website and could not find any other flights with them that  work so unfortunately i made the mistake of requesting a refund i managed to find a flight out of malaga that got me into london just after 10:00 pm so i booked that and then called british-airways as i wanted to discuss compensation that's when they advised me that because i had requested a refund they used the phrase abritish-airwaysndd travel with them they were not prepared to do anything for me apparently i should have called them first and then they  have made the arrangements of course they do not explain that on their website  not they just ask if you want a refund and then proceed and even when i plead my case with the agent at malaga airport and then followed up with customer relations several times via email they flat out refused to budge i had used a travel voucher to cover the cost of my flight and had used avios to cover the cost of my checked british-airwaysggage so in other words no out of pocket costs for the trip once this incident happened i ended up spending 660 euros in airfare and checked british-airwaysggage charges to  to london from malaga ie different airport than the  i had originally booked from and because the luggage storage facility at heathrow had closed by the time i eventually arrived i ended up booking a night at a hotel since i could not travel by train to my cousin's place any longer 3 british-airwaysgs in tow and i did not want to put him out and have him drive to the airport to pick me up this cost me another £125 in room and meal costs all ba ended up doing to compensate me was to give me 5000 free avios  not a mere pittance compared to my out of pocket expenses despite trying to explain to them why i requested the refund instead of calling them first they  not budge very easy for them to say what i should have d since they work there and know the rules and they were not the s scrambling to find alternative travel arrangements within a few hours i pointed out that on their website they should simply instruct customers to call them when this situation happens and that way they  never encounter this problem my feeling is that they put the refund option out there in the hope that customers will make the mistake i did so they can then wash their hands of the situation and ultimately save my i've been an executive club member for years and they simply did not care they said there was nothing they could do i'm sure if  of the ba executive's friends or family members had g through this staff there  have been given the instruction to make things right i used to be a fan of ba but they have really g downhill in my opinion once i used up my remaining avios and travel credit i will cancel my executive club membership and never fly with them again
 an airline that lives in their past glory and heading a future of crisis is british-airways i am not joking we are a family of 7 all in business class heading for a norwegian and arctic cruise and they lost 10 of our british-airwaysgs they will never see me on any of their flights ever a disaster of an airline
  check notin desk rude and dismissive flight late but seems the new norm one world emerald club world check notin staff uncommunicative did not know what british-airwaysggage allowance entitled to once raised politely became argumentative and accusatory
 i chose british-airways especially because i was going to travel with my niece and nephew and wanted everything to work well what a disaster first it took me two hours to do the check notin online due to a technical problem i also had to spend more than 20 minutes in a call to a uk number from my spanish cell ph because thats the only service they provide on weekends then at the airport when there was the boarding time we had to wait with the rest of the people for almost two hours standing on the line without knowing what was going on they just told us to wait finally we could access the plane after 40 minutes inside they told us to leave the plane again and told us the flight had been cancelled we had to take our luggage and queue again for a couple of hours then do the check in again and wait for another flight to take off which was again delayed we spent almost 12 hours at the airport no information was provided no solutions were offered we had to seat in the last raw when i had paid to seat on the first half of the plane no my was refunded no apologizes or compensation was given i also had pre notpurchased food and they couldnt provide the service all in all terrible never again
 i booked premium economy from inv to lax via lhr they notified me of a cancelled flight on my return journey and rebooked me on a flight that my connecting flight arrived too late for then they cancelled a flight on my journey to lax they then cancelled the rebooked flight on the return journey and rebooking me british-airwaysck on the first flight that they had rebooked me on  not the flight that i have no chance of making as my return flight arrives too late into lhr they re notrouted me from lax to jfk to lhr  not which i  have accepted  not but they booked the journey in economy lax to jfk which my husbritish-airwaysnd 6'4 with a knee injury  not cannot do and now they wo not change it  not even though they have a direct flight from lax to lhr with premium economy and unacceptable flight allows us 54 mins to transfer flights at jfk  not and my husbritish-airwaysnd wo not be able to walk slowly let al quickly after enduring the 6 nothour flight from lax to lhr i have chatted only to have my calls disconnected and i also have online chat which proves i did not accept this re notrouted flight to jfk but they wo not budge
 a simple story with an unfortunate outcome that really could happen to any my partner and i recently started working after studying purchased two tickets to travel from london city airport to frankfurt when we purchased the tickets i mistakenly entered my name twice eg mr john smith and ms john smith little did we know that our 1 simple mistake  cost us over 300 pounds upon arriving at the airport we were told there was no way to change the name apparently they can only change 3 letters where there has been a typo and i had no other option to purchase the last remaining ticket if i wanted to board the flight  not the price: almost seven times  higher than my original ticket zero empathy was shown zero alternative was offered trusting ba's staff and under the pretence that there was apparently no other way we could board the flight we bought this ticket immediately after i purchased the ticket i contacted ba's 'commercial change booking team' and informed them of our situation the service representative apologised and told me they could have changed the name at the cost of a small fee he offered to cancel my original ticket and issue me a partial refund then advising me that i had a claim to the difference and i should contact customer support to do so i told this person several times i wanted to claim the cost of the new ticket and even asked him explicitly if by accepting this offer i  be denied from claiming the cost of the new ticket he said no i could claim the difference fair enough  not we accepted this offer and lodged a ticket with customer support for the difference two days later british-airways customer response informed us that we were unable to lodge a claim because we had 'voluntarily accepted the cancellation before the flight' they've continued to send generic emails until this week when they just stopped responding so in short british-airways misled and deceived my partner into accepting a lowbritish-airwaysll offer to waive our right to claim a refund it keeps me up at night thinking how they can do this and  away with it so easily
  flight was delayed due to the inbound flight arriving late there was no announcement to inform of the delay nor were the sceens updated when ready to board we were requested to take our seats quickly to help reduce the delay which people did the pilot then announced he had received the documents for the wrong flight from ground staff so we had to wait while they returned to  the right paperwork after this was resolved the pilot announced there  be a delay as there was only two push british-airwaysck tractors and we had to wait again so after rushing to sit quickly we sat the the aircraft at the gate for nearly  hour which is longer than the flight takes  of course ams is not bas home british-airwaysse and it uses contracted staff here but it should require a better level of service it was embritish-airwaysrrassing hearing the pilot apologise at every step of the way itll be eurostar for me next time
  fast and friendly check in total contrast to gatwick the contract lounge is comfortable and spacious with a british-airwaysr and pleasant staff but you have to pay for alcohol after the  free glass of wine food best avoided on board great crew and dinner was actually good quality and substantial apart from the chocolate and orange pot that seems to appear on every flight  not have they bought up the globritish-airwaysl stock the crew were always ready to top up drinks although white wine and beers were lukewarm the crew explained that the carts are supposed to be chilled  not from experience they rarely are is dry ice so expensive that ba ca not afford it
  i do not understand why british-airways is classified as a 4 star airline the service is really mediocre the food is untasty and insufficient for a long haul trip some members of the cabin crew are friendly but they are not attentive enough and create a very british-airwayssic experience this really is all about ting from point a to b without what it used to be an enjoyable trip making experience the inflight entertainment is fairly good but you do need to bring your own water not to  dehydrated some snacks and ideally food and perhaps smile to yourself as otherwise you are faced with just a cold personality less experience 
  i'm sure that ba have gradually made their economy experience ba euroflyer out of gatwick so miserable that passengers are tempted to upgrade to the lacklustre and overpriced business class long wait at the biz checkin  due to status  and dealt with by a bored agent  not ok third party but still representing ba  not who hardly spoke and avoided eye contact and was more focussed on her fingernails lounge was crowded and grubby but at least the staff there are pleasant and helpful on board the seats are cramped and uncomfortable and it took over two hours before crew appeared with food sales and the free water which on gatwick services consists of a half full plastic cup rather than the luxury of a small bottle a fellow passenger mentid the delay and the fact that they had no sandwiches for sale which prompted the flight attendant to say that the service was much better on easyjet who do two service runs etc
  customer service does not exist one world emerald frequent long haul flyer including ba  not never seen such poor customer service or “computer says no” official bacom site said all morning and afternoon that flight from gatwick delayed 2 hours delayed leaving for airport  notonly for ba to change british-airwaysck to original time called ba customer service 15 hours prior from highway saying situation  not told not to worry  note and flight rebooked if issue but go to airport got to airport 40 mins prior told could not board and that staff did not work for ba so could not help back on ph 3 hours in total to be told could be rebooked then couldnt be round and round ultimately told to file complaint then found out flight left 2 hours delayed paid for extra hotels flights with more competent airlines and now told 38 days wait for complaints to be responded to  not heavens help economy and non notstatus flyers if thats what the front end of the plane s
 another really great pair of flights on time no problems at all champagne was ok and my meal choices were great the new club suite is a good improvement over the previous seat in flight entertainment could have been better cant wait to fly with ba again and enjoy another great experience
  our a380 developed a fault taxiing to the runway  not we returned to the gate only to then have the flight cancelled about 3 hours later due to a technical fault all the while ba staff were virtually non notexistent it was finally the captain who announced the flight was cancelled ba provided an alternative the next day involving a connection but it was very much take this or else you were on your own no arrangements or help made with overnight accommodation or transport  finally managed to  the legal minimum £520 compensation out of ba for the 26 hour delay they caused to my journey and expenses were reimbursed too but even this took four weeks the fact that as a business class customer ba pays the minimum they can  away with says it all  not they could not care less about customers have no interest in loyalty and are not bothered about your business given its our flights that pay ba's way i'd suggest to any they take their hard earned cash to another airline who might at least care less about their customers not recommended 
 horrible airline does not care about their customers used to be decent but has now since really fell off a flight time of 5 hours and 30 mins but no meal while the flight attendants were having their eggs and sausage in the british-airwaysck did not even offer juices i  stick with another airline
  my family and i have flown mostly on british-airways for the last 30 years i am a priority passenger and fly often enough to recognise cabin crew and know some by name they used to be a really good airline to fly with things have really deteriorated with their face to face customer care since the pandemic the aircraft look worn for example on my flight british-airwaysck my audiovisual equipment did not work and had to be reset twice finally working in the last hour before we landed the second time around i think the reset was d for the whole aircraft the touch screen function on my screen did not work the usb charger ports on my seat did not work the staff were pleasant enough but their service oozed mediocrity  there did not seem to be much pride in what they were doing the food has been the worst part on our ba flights since the pandemic they gave us a menu asked what wed like did a check and then told us that it was not available as they had run out and  we like to choose something else they then told us that wed  first choice at the second service which they couldnt deliver on finally after choosing and ting whatever it is that we did the food was tasteless we take part in post flight surveys regularly and have stated all of this to no avail as a family of 3 we fly british-airways medium to long haul regularly possibly 4 not6 times a year each for us the good things about flying ba are that we are priority customers usually have a direct flight to our destinations and  good service on the ground when checking in and in the lounges when we use them
  this has been by far the worst service i have had on a plane it's very obvious that if you are flying economy and not a frequent traveler of british-airways they care very little about you we had to wait an hour for them to even open the check notin once they did they had 5 lines and only  that serviced economy even though the line for economy was three times the length of the premium classes then they told economy passengers that all british-airwaysgs had to be check and no carryon due to a full flight and no room in the overhead compartments once we arrived at the gate there were not enough seats to fit every and you could not leave the boarding area i will never fly this airline again 
  in nov 2022 i booked and paid for a return journey to new zealand on my return journey my final flight was from london to edinburgh on trying to check in i was told my ticket ‘did not exist i showed evidence of my flight being booked and paid for but was denied a ticket my only option was to buy a ticket for a later flight which cost £26507 since nov 22 ie 8 months ago i have communicated multiple times with ba in an attempt to have my my returned they have admitted responsibility for their error which cost me £265 i finally received word from them that they have decided to refund me the sum of £3214 i have asked for an explanation but have received n only a polite e mail informing me that the decision was checked and was correct i do not intend to let this matter go a company worth billions of pounds will not return an hst refund ps they also lost my luggage and did nothing to help me retrieve it i tracked it down myself a week later to edinburgh airport and picked it up myself
 ba is not treating its premium economy passengers with respect you pay for a premium economy service and are then compelled to use the economy toilets at the british-airwaysck of the plane this is short notchanging passengers 
  24 hours before our departure on ba059 to cape town from heathrow on thursday 29th june we did an online check notin seats had already been allocated for my wife and i  not 41 e and f  not which are the middle two seats of the central block of four these were totally unsuitable for us as we are in our late 70's and ting in and out of seats to stretch our legs or go the the toilet  mean climbing over a person on the aisle but there were no other seats available we got to heathrow about 6 hours before departure and tried to change seats at check notin to no avail although the lady was very sympathetic and tried her utmost she did offer us an upgrade to premium economy but at 450gbp each it was beyond our affordability she said we should try again at the departure gate but that also failed we spoke to a member of the flight crew who was totally unsympathetic the economy seats are so tiny that i was jammed shoulder to shoulder between by wife and a stranger with knees touching the seat pocket in front for 12 hours we suffered when we did manage to  out of our seat due to the kindness of the young lady next to me on the aisle it was a mission trying to clamber past the reclined british-airwaysckrest in front of me ba economy is absolutely awful the evening meal was near notinedible  not both choices were spicy foods which are not very suitable when flying especially for an older person the breakfast spanish omelette was however not british-airwaysd at all the previous day we had flown economy from malta to heathrow on malta airlines and that 3 hour trip was a pleasure the seats are wide and there is ample legroom if they can do it then why not british-airways
  we arrived at heathrow at 0600 to find our flight to ibiza was cancelled by ba with no explanation as if that wasnt galling enough the customer service from ba at the airport was non notexistent there was no explanation no apology and no assistance in finding an alternative flight weve managed to find another flight from stansted but that isnt until much later today thus wasting a chunk of our short trip i simply dont understand why ba dont proactively contact their customers to notify them of a cancellation and work with them to resolve the problem shocking customer service
  original flight was cancelled with no explanation there was no representative to help in rebooking we had to call customer service long distance call the line kept dropping had to do 40 + calls to find new booking only to discover the only way i could fly the next day was by paying business class no help with hotel for the night stay
  airport check in was functionary with little warmth but some efficiency flight was delayed with no communication given boarding was chaotic and no management of the process by ground staff seats on board are tight and you really feel like they have crammed in every seat possible there is next to no recline however i was thankful that there was no recline if the person in front had even the slightest recline they  be in my face owing to how tight the seats were spaced on this a321 aircraft no amenities on this flight except for a toilet that was clean but small no ife no food and beverage unless you pay extra but the staff were friendly luggage arrived at the carousel within a very short amount of time
  flight fine in notline with competitors pleasant crew only niggle is bussed to and from aircraft at heathrow it seems like this is standard for the berlin flights would use again
  came from glasgow to london and took connecting flight american airlines from london to north carolina it's my third day here in north carolina and still waiting for my luggage they did not even bother to transfer the luggage to connecting flight luggage are still in glasgow 
  my flight on on 12 may 2023 got delayed an hour and 25 minutes which resulted in the cancellation of our connection flight on 12 may 2023 as the arrival of the first flight was only 15 before the departure of the second connecting flight we contacted the ba call center multiple times to make changes to the flight in order to still arrive on the 12th of may to kef airport through different flights the team tried to find a solution but n made sense not even on the next day the 13th of may 2023 we have made full booking of accommodation car rental activities etc for the vacation in iceland the cancellation of of these booking is not refundable the call center suggested that we cancel the flight for a full refund then claim compensation for the delay and difference in airfare cost and other non refundable bookings due to the delay and cancellation of our flight british-airways responded to the claim after a month with no compensation at all even though we paid additional $600 on new bookings and additional charges the refund of the cancelled flight took more than a month with multiple calla to follow up almost every week i was promised to  refund on the first call but later i found out it was not processed properly every nottime i call the agent ask questions about why flight was canceled etc which is annoying when my understanding everything was under process for payment after multiple calls i was refunded partially and not the full amount which is even bizarre from a company of this level i had to make more calls to  the remaining british-airwayslance refunded the whole experience was terrible
  cairo is a 5 hour flight and ba considers it to be short haul so every is crammed in with knees pressed up against the seat in front and nothing in the way of inflight entertainment not even a magazine  not which is now available by wifi that you have to pay for you have to pay for your seat choice checked in british-airwaysggage food & drink wifi not that i have anything against that  not i'm used to that on bud airlines  not but this is for a premium price ticket i  have preferred to fly on easyjet where the initial ticket  have been less and the extras  have been half the price the ba app and website makes it really difficult to understand the extras and we ended up with british-airwaysggage on the wrong ticket so had to pay extra and do not  me started on their customer service helpline on board the staff are ok but on the long cairo notlondon route they spend most of their time on a break where they use the british-airwaysck row or two and talk loudly without any consideration for the passengers and for the flyers who do not want the hassle of charges minimal cabin service and bud seats then they could easily provide a 'premium economy' option  and really make a difference for the experience heathrow terminal 5 compounds the poor experience especially for arrivals it is also poorly served by transport links  not especially for those of us who live near gatwick which is being abritish-airwaysndd by ba i have been a frequent flyer for many years  not and was even a ba gold card holder at  point  not so i know about the potential experience i used be able to make the choice  not do i fly bud or do i fly more comfortably for more now it's a case of flying bud or flying bud for double the price with ba 
  after travelling london to madrid with british-airways then with iberia from madrid to lima and latam to cuzco my luggage arrived 7 days after me when attempting to collect my luggage mine was the only  not to arrive i sought help and was informed to make a claim online when my british-airwaysg finally arrived 7 days later the lock had been forced open and everything inside the case searched some emptied my 1st aid kit and toiletries and threw my clothing about i felt violated i have been treated appallingly from start to finish for a month i have been british-airwaysck and forth to british-airways yet they stated it is not their fault 
  my luggage was mis nottagged in dallas on my way to cairo via london my luggage arrived at lhr as planned on saturday 6/24 however upon arrival due to the luggage being mis nottagged and having the incorrect name on my luggage it was never sent to cairo its sitting in terminal 3 in lhr i have an air tag on my luggage and british-airways is saying there is nothing they can do about it i have filed 3 claims made 13 ph calls have been hung up on 3x and as simple as it is to solve this problem the workers at ba refuse to solve the problem 
  the airline lost my luggage and was absolutely awful throughout the entire trip they gave me no updates their website sucks and it was nearly impossible to  some on the ph they finally delivered my luggage to my hotel after i had left to go british-airwaysck to the us 5 days after i told them to ship it british-airwaysck to the us now ive been calling everyday begging them to  my british-airwaysg british-airwaysck to me they appease me on the ph tell me theyre fixing it but nothing changes the hotel cant  in touch with them and they havent even tried to pick to british-airwaysg british-airwaysck up several times when i called i got a message saying they were not answering due to too many complaints and calls and to “call british-airwaysck later” 
  we booked on the ba website round trip flights from seattle to amman with a stop in london in business class our first flight was delayed and then diverted to nyc and enroute my husbritish-airwaysnd experienced a medical emergency when we landed in nyc we were taken to a hospital and i stayed in constant contact with the airline agent who had arranged for the ambulance transfer the same evening we flew british-airwaysck home confirming cancellation of all remaining flights with the agent at the airport for the next several weeks we spoke many times with ba customer service trying to obtain some kind of refund — we were met with contradictory explanations excuses and an absence of meaningful customer service we discovered we had been marked as “no notshows” for our flight to amman and that our return flight was still active we were unable to cancel the return on the website despite booking on the website our ph calls were never returned we spent a minimum of 40 not60 minutes on hold for every ph call we made our emails received only canned replies without answers or explanations we were told it was “not possible” to receive a copy of the ticketing rules and regulations nor to speak with a supervisor and after several weeks of this abysmal customer service i filed a complaint with the faa in response to my complaint i received an email from ba customer service explaining that they had reviewed my many requests for a “full refund” but that could not be accommodated due to the ticketing rules they  issue flight credits  not except for the portion for which we no notshowed they did not state how many credits we never once asked for a full refund  not we asked to read the rules and to receive a partial refund we will not use the credits  not we were fully refunded by our travel insurance
  first time flying with ba business class never again there are no boarding drinks provided my meal quality was below business class standards as was the quality of the wine on arrival at bodrum my british-airwaysgs were among the last to appear not looking forward to the same chaos on the return flight 
 you can buy sandwiches and crisps but do not expect a hot meal because the plane is a narrow body  there are no screens not helping matters is the fact that the ba prebooking shop for food did not recognise the flight number and the onboard  wifi did not work 
  this is a two notfor not review covering economy and business class on the ba flight from london city to ibiza economy was excellent a very light lunch small cheese notand notpastrami sandwich chocolate brownie followed by a pretty much free notflowing drinks trolley the flight was full but the crew worked hard and did a very good job this is a flight i  recommend except do not fall for the last minute offer for an upgrade to business for £100+ in each direction as i did i flew economy out and business british-airwaysck while my brother flew business then economy the business seats are identical to economy with no seats blocked so you are squished in four abreast the meals are almost identical with minor tweaks such as a yoghurt for your £100 the only real plus is champagne but on my flight there was n because of supply issues the cabin attendant i think his name was tom must be  of the best in the business i did not eat so i paid £100 for nothing oh well so great flight but stick with economy
 absolutely horrible airline communication is terrible last minute delays cancellations seat changes with no communication app and website user experience is years behind other airlines seats are cramped and uncomfortable overpriced would not fly again
  having experienced delays and cancellations departing from usa to europe and now a 35 hour estimated delay at lhr heading british-airwaysck to usa i  warn travelers that ba has become unreliable and is now on my “do not fly” list until they  better organized 
 travelled to heathrow to kalamata and return journey 11 days later world traveller aka economy class both flights departed on time return flight landed early  not but  not we then had a 1 1/4 hour wait for the british-airwaysggage to be offloaded which rather ruined the journey home as we then caught a motorway closure flights ok  not fa's particularly on return flight pleasant enough but as usual economy class seating was truly dreadful  not no legroom at all no better in club class either  not only the middle seat left free marked down because of this can only recommend if you are not tall
  this flight failed at every level we were delayed and arrived at our destination late so that our prepaid car transfer phd to advise us that he could only wait another 10 minutes for us but this was a ba holiday we pre ordered food for our flight and this was never loaded onto our flight and to finally compound british-airways complete and utter uselessness our luggage was still in heathrow as there is no flight tomorrow the earliest this luggage could possible arrive is very late on wednesday evening having only the clothes that you flew in and reading you can only claim for toiletries and underwear seems to be the antithesis of a happy holiday i might have expected a complimentary sc in lieu of no food but no we were told that we could purchase from the trolley what they had available i  like to make it clear that we are british airways bronze level holders which as we have been long retired shows how we have used this airline historically
  beware of british-airways and their marketing to make you believe that they are full of class and level above the rest they wo not treat you that way when you  bumped from a flight and it is their responsibility to compensate you for their mistakes we recently had a trip home planned from mrs to sea a mechanical issue meant that we departed late from mrs to lhr where we needed to make a connecting flight we landed with plenty of time to make it to our next gate but a series of issues and choices by british-airways kept us from boarding our next plane the crew did not let off passengers with connecting flights first nor did they hold the next flight for a mere 5 not10 minutes for passengers to make connections on their airlines plus we discovered that we had actually been bumped off our next flight before we even landed we were pushed to virgin atlantic to figure out how to  us home it extended our travel day by 8 hours we were traveling with children as well no offers of compensation or upgrades were made and now ba is refusing to provide us any financial compensation we paid for a trip home with only  connection and instead had two connections multiple airlines to deal with security through an extra airport with kids for a midnight flight we were never planning on that is not what we paid for but ba refuses to make it right so beware potential travelers
  i flew from cairo to heathrow on what they call euro club class which is a cramped coach seat with the middle empty seat horrible service i  to heathrow airport 40 minutes late so i had to run around looking for my connecting flight finally jumping through escalators and train to another building where is my gate given a seat that is different than what i paid extra for  its a shame for such well known airline
 i flew with numerous airlines but i gotta admit british-airways is by far the worst airline ever when it comes to customer support i waited 3 weeks for a ticket change call center workers are giving you false information just so they  make you hang up they told me i was supposed to  an email from them with the flight changes but never got they do not have a live chat just like american airlines do they do not have a online form to submit your questions they don t have a working international number total garbritish-airwaysge
  we were traveling as a family 5 people because of an accident by the airport we arrived at the airport only 1 hour before the flight the kiosk was unable to read  of our passports and we had to go to check notin the lady at the check notin checked the passport and gave us a boarding pass because we had no extra time we headed straight to security and didnt realize the lady gave us a duplicated boarding pass not of the passport holder we got stuck in security because of that couldnt figure out what was wrong we only didnt miss the flight because we ran through the airport with a 70 year old and a 9 year old included in the party the staff at the gate was very cordial and helpful once we arrived there
 flight at 840am from dub to lcy cancelled 1155pm night before no text message no ph waiting at bus stop and randomly checked email to see alternate flight option hang on whats this it was dark at 5am it was hard to see mobile ph screen im still jet lagged only option was to lhr at 920am tried calling no  there so accepted it but i didnt see the day change it was the next day i didnt want the flight as was staying at docklands hence choosing lcy but thought i better take it as its leaving an hour after the original flight nope i better call to say hey sorry i screwed up your flight is not going to work for me i dont have any more accommodation in dublin and i dont want to waste  night in london called the most surly customer service can you even be called that when you treat people like this answered she kept calling me james not my name she was brutal you accepted it i cant do anything she british-airwayssically made me feel like a moron because in a moment of confusion i accepted the first available flight from the stupid supercomputer she kept telling me about the algorithm and this was the flight that was chosen but if you had called us we could have put you onto a aer lingus flight why didnt you call you are at fault just so callous and uncaring she wanted to charge me 600 pounds in new flights and change fees i said nope and booked a flight today with ryanair plus i need to find my way from gatwick to docklands more my from me because of bas utter contempt for their passengers ive been flying qantas for 25 years and they can do some funky stuff but never this level of cruelty because of  simple error never again how do people accept such utter contempt and ineptitude welcome to the uk just wow
  terrible i have traveled twice with them this year via business class and they have been significantly delayed or cancellations with connecting flights the customer service or complete lack of it is appalling and has forced me to change credit cards as i no longer intend to use ba for any further flights terrible uncomfy old planes and miserable staff 
  the customer service is ugly tried calling two weeks ago but still had problems with flight all i  is some in india i thought i was flying iberia once i looked close at ticket it was british-airways will never fly british airway ever again
  most uncomfortable flight i have ever experienced it's a long time since i have flown long nothaul the cramped conditions were awful the rows were so close toher when the person in front reclined their seat my tv was so close i could not focus on it  ba seem to want to make economy so uncomfortable to encourage customers to upgrade this has not worked on me i will avoid flying ba in future my onward flight was with latam same 787 aircraft but more room between rows far more comfortable on the return flight from santiago the lights were turned down at 8pm i feel the cabin crew do this to avoid providing a service they just disappear behind the curtains
  i booked our first out of country trip to take my husbritish-airwaysnd on a surprise trip to monaco i gave us over 3 hours for our connecting flight to and from home through heathrow our flight left seattle an hour late causing us to miss our connecting flight we were rescheduled before we even landed they booked us on a flight 7 hours later and offered no food tickets or any other type of reimbursement additionally we sat in their customer service line for an hour and a half to see if they could rebook us on an earlier flight to watch them continually assist other customers that walked up outside of the queue no earlier flights were available when we arrived in nice france the airport was closed including the rental car desk we were not offered any assistance from the airline on a room or other accommodation for the night we found a cab which cost us 85 euros   to  to our hotel we thought there is no way something like this could happen on the way home…we were wrong our flight from nice to heathrow was 30 minutes late with a 25 hour layover you  think we should still make our flight unfortunately long security lines caused over 15 hr further delay when arriving ba closed the doors and said they could not hold the plane any longer despite arriving 15mins before departure after running through the heathrow airport and going through security again they sent us british-airwaysck to the customer service queue where the first statement was we cant  you out until tomorrow after begging they found us a flight on another airline at that time we were told our british-airwaysgs were transferred to our flight with delta we were given 8 pounds each for snacks at the airport for our now additional 5 hour delay in total for our trip there and home we spent 13 hours at heathrow airport which our original total layover of 6 hours and we were offered 8 pound each unfortunately the drama continues the two british-airwaysgs that they said made the delta flight shockingly did not we were told that we had the file the claim with delta since the last part of our flight was with them we have now been home for 5 days and each airline is pointing the finger at the other as i said to both of them today i dont care who has my british-airwaysgs figure it out and send me my luggage i do not want your $500 reimbursement per british-airwaysg as that doesnt come close to the memories and stuff that i have in there i will never fly british-airways again and deltas british-airwaysggage people are not doing great either
 my husbritish-airwaysnd and i booked seats within our premium economy booking on both outward journey ba015 on 12 february and return on 11 march we were last or almost last to be served food each time they had run out of our choices on  occasion i did not eat as only available option was curry which disagrees with me on all flights there appeared to be an undue focus on curry/spicy food all in all very disappointing and left us with a very poor opinion of british-airways
  may 3 flew from seattle to heathrow then to edinburgh ba lost my golf british-airwaysg which caused me to purchase golf shoes club rentals tees british-airwayslls i had tee times at two courses in st andrews that took months to make the promised my british-airwaysg returned in 24 hours and they  reimburse occurred expenses i contacted ba and they state they  only reimburse toiletries then the return flight home was randomly canceled by ba without notifying me or without notice two weeks before the scheduled flight i contacted the corporate travel team they informed me ba canceled my return reservation they rebooked me on the same flight ba customer service was horrendous and make false promises i will never use this airlines again beware of british-airways they also randomly canceled my girlfriend and her fathers flight and they are both gold members
 i went through three flights to reach my destination all of my ba flights without exception were delayed both on my way to my destination and british-airwaysck from my destination which is understandable to an extent what's not understandable is that they were not prepared for  of the flights and delayed by almost an hour so i ended up missing a flight and for that they rebooked me 24h ahead providing only accommodation which they messed up as well and after 30 hours of traveling i had to wait and hope that the hotel  find an extra room since ba did not communicate properly with them i gave ba a chance to correct their mistake by contacting them after the flights but all they did was answer once with a lot of serious complaints that were involved with their flights and all they did was tell me to contact their partners that i had the last flight with which went smoothly and they had nothing to do with the previously addressed complaints i contacted them and gave them over a week asking why they did not address any of my complaints that their partner could have nothing to do with and they just ghosted me 2/10 for the kind personnel that's holding this airline toher though
 an excellent flight in club world on british-airways the welcome aboard was warm and that continued throughout the flight the crew were attentive friendly and very professional on board food for dinner and breakfast was good and there was a well chosen selection of wines in flight entertainment offered a great selection of films and audio the seat/flat bed was very comfortable  not british-airways have d an excellent job in the design and comfort of the suites on board the a350 i liked the sleek minimalist design this flight showed that ba can be among the worlds best airlines
 the flight schedule was delayed for  hour after boarding the plane we were delayed at least another 30 minutes when we arrived in london we were delayed again for at least another 30 minutes to find a gate we were left with 45 minutes only to catch our connecting flight to barcelona we needed to run and take the train to different terminal to catch our next connecting flight when we arrived at barcelona airport we discovered that our check in luggage was still in london very painful trip disrupted our vacation not flying with ba anymore if i can find alternative airlines 
 the worst experience in all my years of travel my first flight with my two kids from boston to london was delayed by 2 hours resulting in me missing my connecting flight despite having a layover of approximately 25 hours i ended up waiting until 430 pm to board my flight to cairo unfortunately even that flight was delayed i  strongly advise avoiding this particular airline even if it means paying a bit more for a different option
  the worst experience in all my years of travel bag was destroyed flight delayed 3 hours and could not  water on board then when attempting to claim on their website the entire site failed on a dropdown menu that  not work you ca not contact them plane was filthy and some else's belongings and left over food was still in our seat
  terrible delays had to rebook our domestic travel for 5 passengers and havent received any reimbursement on the same lost all my luggage; received luggage after 4 days had to purchase new clothes for the family for a wedding no customer service rep picks up the ph
  a serious medical problem appeared while i was onboard i informed the crew and they helped me out unfortunately i was in transit but travelling further became too difficult because of how unwell i became also i could not find my way british-airwaysck home in my condition thankfully the crew has helped me in every step of the journey until i returned british-airwaysck home it was a stressful experience but the crew of british-airways made it way more tolerable
  i have not flown british-airways before and will never fly them again the check notin process was terrible and slow there were over 30 people in the regular check in line and they had two agents working it they had  agent working the first class line it should not take that long to check people in especially when people should have checked in online ahead of time our group checked in online and almost missed our plane because of the slow counter service we had to run to the gate and we did make it but they were terrible
  my itinerary was supposed to be las vegas notchicago notlondon notvenice when i landed in london heathrow i was stuck on the aircraft for 2 hours with no explanation as to why and because of such a delay i missed my connecting flight to venice getting off the plane was when the real nightmare took place our flight had over 300 people aboard meaning many were in a rush to  to their flights or had already missed their flight they put us into two lines  of them being for people who missed their flight i waited approximately 10 minutes just to come up to a clerk who told me since i missed my flight i  have to go to the connecting flight ba service desks for further assistance if i were to have known that was the only information i  receive i  have skipped being in that line altoher when i went to the service desk where there were more than 60+ people standing in line i waited 30+ minutes until a clerk came by passing every a pamphlet telling people to create an account online and to book our flights through the ba site since their systems were down and could not rebook any it was a hassle doing anything through he ba site so i ended up calling the helpline after waiting to be connected to a ba rep i spoke with a woman who said i  have to call iberia airlines for a rebook i called iberia and they said since i booked through expedia i  have to call them expedia then said i  have to call ba for the rebook so when i called ba again the rep said the only flight he could  me booked for was for the following monday mind you i was travelling since the 25th which was a friday all the hotels in the vicinity of the airport were booked i was trying to figure out where my checked british-airwaysggage went i still do not have it most of the customer service i got from ba reps was horrible service as if they could care less for the predicament their company caused me they acted like i was inconveniencing them with my issues i also had to sleep in the airport waiting for my flight the next morning because hotels were booked overall my experience with british airlines has been the worst airline experience i've ever had to deal with i will never book with this company again i  rather pay more my for a ticket in a different airline than buy through this company again
  busy day at lhr and flight full lounge crowded but b gates lounge quieter flight left on time very professional crew greeted by name and executive club status acknowledged and thanked for return custom a nice touch service was good food average entertainment good early arrival quick processing at jfk all good
 worst seats i have ever encountered in economy class no leg room at all i had to spread my legs to fit staff at the terminal rude “business class” offers the same seat but with more legroom and they block the middle seat they cram people in seats with no legroom and block off the same seat type at the front of the plane where there is more legroom just so the “business class” passenger has an empty seat between them plane is old with no onboard entertainment for a 3 hours flight last time i will fly british-airways
 top ten reasons to not use british-airways to all: be aware and be on notice not travel at your own risk i have travelled for years on many different airlines and i have to say that british-airways ranks as  of the top two most horrible airlines to fly dont waste your time or my customer service is non notexistent please be on notice that if you purchase a ticket from them and once they have your my you can kiss any customer service and or help resolving your issue goodbye we used them to travel to europe and it was the worst experience i have had with an airline in years when you work hard and save your my to travel you expect a good experience welp not with this company who i am sure makes millions on customers per year i understand that sometimes things happen but this started right after we booked our flight and the bad experience did not end until we set foot back to our hometown please take note: #1  not the customer service number is buried on the internet and not listed on their website i had to google it and still got the run around when some finally answered trust me the number is a secret #2 – when you finally find a customer service number there is a long wait and when or if some answers they will not resolve your issues instead they pass the buck to whatever airlines that they sold your ticket to no one takes ownership #4 not what airlines operates 365 days a year and around the clock but doesnt have customer service reps to help you the customer british airways thats who #5  not they will cancel your flight without notice and not notify you at all no email no text #6 not if you are not the primary on your ticket you will  no notifications or even if you are the primary you may or may not  notifications #7  not if you pay for seats and you pick them it doesnt matter they will cancel your seats and not refund your my and then play stupid #8  not the flight may be cheaper but it is not once you are d paying for seats #9 not they will route to another partner airline and not notify you #10 – if you have a connecting flight they will cancel  leg and not the other and not notify you i will never use them again and if this review helps  person that heeds my advice then my job is d
  easy check in on the way to heathrow the flight was on time with no issues our return flight to valencia was booked for the afternoon and our long haul flight arrived early at heathrow this was with another airline and was not a connecting flight i asked at the british-airways check in if we could be put onto the morning flight british-airwaysck to valencia to avoid seven hours waiting at heathrow we had our flights changed with no cost and were checked in within five minutes that is indeed customer service thank you
  online check in worked fine quick security check once onboard quick flight up to glasgow water and snack provided all in all very pleased cheap quick and efficient
 the ba first lounge at terminal 5 was a  zoo at 2pm dirty tables and used tableware everywhere worse than this the usual atrocious boarding gate service and boarding started 50 mins late the flight was operated by a finnair a320 which is british-airwaysrely low cost standard let al business class hard thin uncomfortable seats poor legroom and the cabin was simply tatty  not i remain shocked that ba allow this and it's time for ba's ceo and management focused on standards rather than bean counting finnair cabin staff were fundamentally courteous but they provide a very trimmed down bud airline type service as the whole trip turned out to be  not and yet this business class ticket was  of the more expensive on recent trips i thought post covid that ba were better for a few months but with the many cost cuts they are making they fall well below all other european full service airlines 
 paid a quick visit to nice yesterday from heathrow decided to go business class since my last short haul flight in economy was a real crush and rather unpleasant i paid over £300 for a business class round trip i went into the to ba lounge in terminal 5 which was very crowded being 630 in the morning i decided against having a drink and stuck to the breakfast offering the cooked options did not look that appealing but the fresh fruit selection was very enjoyable we subsequently discovered a much nicer ba lounge closer to the gate b36 and waited there for 40 mins boarding was efficient and we got ourselves seated in 2a and 2c seat 2b was blocked out which acted as an additional table there did not seem to be any difference in the width of the seat from the cramped seating in economy but there may have been an additional inch of leg room i think that ba are trying to outdo easyjet in terms on no frills it  not cost ba that much to supply business class passengers with a complimentary newspaper to read during the flight the inflight magazine is no longer available there are no screens so there was zero in terms of in flight entertainment the inflight wifi was flaky at best and non notexistent at other times i was glad it was only a two hour flight i really do not think the fare that we paid was worth the my
  words fail to describe this last awful flight  not british-airwaysby across the aisle crying for most of the flight and although horrible to go without any rest for the long flight lhr/sfo it's understandable for a british-airwaysby to cry nonstop  not but the crew yakking loudly in the galley even after a polite notification that their conversation could be heard in the cabin  not that made the flight unbearable for any rest or sleep always difficult anyway westbound the food was so british-airwaysd that most  turned down whatever the nasty offering was on the 2nd service what happened to the really nice tea and scs i've said this before after suffering through the ba concept of customer service ie do not do anything to help the passenger if it involves any extra work  not this time i swear i mean it  not never again on ba please the lounge was so packed even a single traveler had a hard time finding a seat  not poor ba is on the skids downhill
  absolutely terrible experience the app  not let me check in online and repeatedly asked for covid documents but then did not accept them even when provided i was trying to fly british-airwaysck to the usa where i am a citizen and the app caused repeated errors i went to british-airways customer service to check in and was told that my seat was already given away to another passenger even though i was there in plenty of time this was also during an industrial action at heathrow meaning the number of flights were limited i was delayed over 24 hours in returning to the usa all because of their terrible app and then british-airwaysd customer service that gives away seats even when the paid passenger is already there at the airport
 ba overbook every flight to maximise their income with no regard for the customer it means you cannot check in online or at the kiosk in the airport and have to queue even with no luggage makes easyjet and ryanair look like customer champions the server in itsu in the ba terminal says she stopped flying ba years ago due to the service being british-airwaysd all the time most customers she serves have a complaint staff do not care as poor service and unhappy customers is a routine occurrence
"  
the flights were all on time except belfast from london which never is the staff were efficient my issue is the app i could not book seats to tel aviv though tried for a month as wanted to pay so ended up in a middle seat even though a window seat was available on the flight the seat was in front of the dividing british-airwaysrrier and was used as thoroughfare by the service team throughout the flight so i wasted my my on pe seat you can  hold of ba customer service via the app either and they have just ignored all other communication so just wo not use them again"
 only the second time flying ba as first time wasnt positive could have made my connection in heathrow if ba had been proactive instead overnight at the renaissance hotel compliments of ba adequate but  wonders why a large part of this hotel is devoted to sleeping and feeding of hundreds of stranded passengers if ba had offered  employee to help us  to our gate instead of waiting for the shuttle bus which was a half hour late arriving we could have made our flight and saved ba the cost of rebooking hotel shuttle food accommodations another british-airwaysd show business class fare should offer more
 i was not going to bother reviewing this flight as i seem to be on a perpetual downer with ba but the airport experience convinced me otherwise after having our flight class reduced from first to business then offered an alternative route on the outward leg in first to make up for the disappointment they then reneged on this as it was a special anniversary it sucked flying british-airwaysck we checked in online to our chosen window seats at the gate we had to show our passports as we passport before boarding as we were hand luggage only trying to board we had our passports checked twice more and were issued new boarding cards for centre seats unbelievable the flight itself was very quiet and only half the normal crew for this aircraft was unavailable this meant no pre notdeparture drinks and a limited selection of food the crew was great but what an earth is going on at ba they have this unique knack to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory every time i say this as the new club suites are great
  i booked business class tickets for my fiancé and i i had to reschedule my flight due to an unforeseen timing change so i called to  have my flight refunded the representative on the ph informed me he was not sure how much i   as the refund department needed to check but estimated i  lose 10 not20% of my booking to fees i accepted i never got a cancellation email or any update but instead received $35 total british-airwaysck less than 1% of my booking costs since then i have spent over 5 hours calling different departments before they blocked me i've lost a tremendous amount of my with nothing to show
  i will never travel with british-airways again i spent over $10000 on a business class seat to attend a funeral in the uk first the boeing 787 not9 cabin has 7 seats across the aisle so what you are ting in reality is premium economy the seats are narrow and effectively are a business class seat cut in half they have squeezed these seats in which means that some passengers bump their heads into the bulkhead when they stand up and many have to clamber over others to go to the toilet which wakes up that passenger the whole point about business class is that you pay to rest and have privacy and not have some push over the top of you second the food was disgusting third the service terrible fourth the toilet was tiny fifth the inflight screen was fixed and too high so i could not see anything sixth their british-airwaysggage handling is also appalling meaning that my taxi was waiting for 2 hours and i had to pay more no free airport transfers with british-airways seventh the charging points did not work the second leg to london was on a larger plane with 4 seats across the aisle that was bearable because no hopping over people but the seat was very uncomfortable because it was not  piece this means that you are sleeping on a metal british-airwaysr the seat where there is a gap in the seat to add insult to injury i now find that both flights british-airwaysck to sydney are on the small plane to book a seat before check in is $170 i paid it but note that there were only 4 seats left this is why i got the worst seat in the house going out this is the most appalling airline service i have ever encountered there is no point paying for business class in british-airways 
  i am already in portugal so contacted them today and they cancelled my return flight because i was 10 minutes late calling them even though i tried for 2 hours to  through the day before now i am unable to  british-airwaysck and they have kept the 500 pounds customer service is shocking they have no intention of helping you
  terrible avoid this airline its now becoming regular practice to cancel flights had a cancellation from switzerland that forced us to spend the whole night in a cheap hotel and had to fly out the next day and then had another cancellation to spain the airline only knows how to ask for expensive prices
  despite being a gold member the british-airways staff in heathrow literally could not care in the slightest about the absolute turmoil and logistical damage or wider impact of their terrible service all the staff members repeat the same mantra  not “we are not obliged to provide even an update for the first 24 hours” as if that  make the situation better there are no proactive updates no empathy no care but a lot of actual lies being told you can tell that they have given up any care or thought for the passengers as actual individuals  not they show this in every action and word they say all of them are better suited to working away from other humans
 regarding the aircraft and seat: the business class seats on this flight were pretty good all were of the suite type where every seat has its own booth with sliding door for extra privacy the downside to this is that if you are travelling as a couple its quite difficult to interact there is ample storage and usb charging ports the seat is pretty comfortable as some who finds it very difficult to sleep on flights this was  of the only times i've been able to  a few minutes sleep here and there the amenities provided are pretty average when compared to other airlines the leather toiletry british-airwaysg was quite nice though no slippers only a pair of socks the restrooms on the flight are very small and do not provide much in the way of toiletries compared to other airlines no free wi notfi in business class is not acceptable another example of ba's penny pinching in recent years regarding the staff and customer service: poor inattentive beyond meal times there was offer of water during the flight i had to go and find an attendant and ask there was also no offer of any snacks rude at times my partner asked for a fork to be replaced as the  provided was quite clearly dirty the attendant was incredibly rude in response this left us shocked different customers seem to receive a different quality of service a customer behind me was repeatedly greeted politely by name and asked how they were whether they needed anything etc whereas my partner and i were not afforded the same level of personal service this is disappointing as we paid the same price for the tickets so expect the same level of service the food was pretty british-airwaysd i had risotto while my partner had chicken both were extremely over cooked and the rice looked like porridge the veables were discoloured and flavourless the bread was nice though the breakfast was not much better summary: ba has become the ryanair of long haul the customer service is way below what i  expect for a premium airline in a premium seat you pay a premium price for a very average service if there are other options available i  choose them over ba these days
 i travelled with british-airways from sweden to los angeles via london in december 2022 when i arrived at lax  of my british-airwaysgs were missing there was no information of the whereabouts of my british-airwaysg and after searching for some for about 30 minutes i found the point of contact and she told me my british-airwaysg was left behind i gave her my details of where i  be staying and she told me that they  contact me after a few days and still no contact i tried to call british-airways customer service the woman at the airport didnt give me a file reference number so it was quite difficult to try and locate my british-airwaysg but they finally found the reference number and my british-airwaysg and said it  be delivered in a couple of days i told them that i had switched hotels and gave them the address for where i was staying and everything was fine but then a couple of weeks went by and my british-airwaysg was still nowhere to be seen and it was time for me to fly home at the airport i tried to talk with the personnel there to try and locate my british-airwaysg and they said that it was delivered to the first hotel i stayed at even though i had given them an updated address i asked them what i should to since i was flying home now the guy at the counter told me that it wasnt his problem and that i should figure it out myself i questid him about his response and he just walked away a manager saw that and came up to me and apologized for his colleague and that they  send some to fetch my british-airwaysg and send it with either my flight or the next  i came home and a couple of days later i received my british-airwaysg i made a complaint and claims on british-airways website since i had to buy clothes and toiletries during my vacation because i didnt have my british-airwaysg in january they said that they  refund me for my claims it is now april almost may and i have still not received the refund even after multiple email conversations i dont know what to do anymore about this situation since it appears that no  is willing to help me i am appalled about how the situation is being handled and frankly disappointed at british-airways and the lack of customer service
  food was lousy who ever is planning the asian hindu vearian meal is clueless as to what this meal includes the snack was also lousy it took us 2 hours just to go from t5 to t3 and clear security check the place was chaotic we  to our boarding gate and again a long line with 40 minutes wait for some to check passport and boarding pass seats in premium economy was ok but when the passenger in front reclines there is very little space for the window seat passenger to cross over overall not a good airline
 had the worst experience the flight from london to toronto got delayed and we missed the connecting flight to halifax we were four including an infant and a toddler aged 4 years despite being delayed and missed the connecting flight the ground staff were not at all helpful we waited for an hour to  them to talk to us and at 12 am they told us they have not booked any hotel for us to stay that night and asked to go search for a hotel on your own very nice of you british-airways at least you guys should have given some consideration to the travelers who travel with children and booked some accommodation we will not to travel on this airline again
  the ground staff were not helpful felt like all they wanted to do was rush us to check in and then all passengers needed up waiting in a holding area for a bus anyway travelling with a child with a disability was a nightmare with british-airways logged a complaint and it took almost four weeks to answer lost some of our luggage it was not a good experience
  second time ba premium economy in a newer aircraft and yet another excellent experience despite a three hour delay and missing my connection in hong kong this was a very pleasant flight seats are spacious and comfortable in premium economy in this layout attitude of the cabin crew was excellent and food was good they communicate well and rebooked my connection during the flight which brought peace of mind a very pleasant experience in ba premium economy after a major disappointment in club world earlier this year
  they changed our flights from brussels to london heathrow to lax on 4/16/2023 we paid extra to choose our seats since they cancelled they never honored the seat that we bought they seated us in totally different seats i asked the check in employee she was very rude and told us that we have to understand that was a different flight from london to lax was worse nobody in the airport help us employees from ba told us that we have to return next day for our flight we can rent a hotel or go terminal 3 and sleep there finally  employee help us and gives a voucher for hotel it was a nightmare this airline we missed  day work and ba didnt return the my that we paid for our previous chosen seats
  at copenhagen the most chaotic ticket counter assignment in the history of airlines time on board never changed no fixed counter at airport abysmal service that needs vast improvement here
  worst experience of my life trying to deal with the customer service for british-airways so many issues with ting from  destination to the other had an absolutely horrible time trying to  answers or reach any who was capable of helping navigate uncertainties i wrote them a formal complaint requesting some type of refund and received a generic “we are sorry” email with 5000 avios attached which is equivalent to maybe $50 on a $600+ flight needless to say these will go to waste as i refuse to fly with an untrustworthy incompetent unorganized airline that couldnt even address  single issue expressed to them it was equivalent to handing me a british-airwaysnd aid after slapping me in the face i will say the flight itself was smooth and the onboard staff was kind and attentive the most frustrating thing is that the customer service is trained to give you the runaround so heavily to the point of exhaustion that you just give up trying and take the loss
  due to code sharing with cathay pacific i was downgraded to ba on my return leg i cant describe how cheated i felt i booked and paid for an airline with great entertainment food and service instead i was forced to go hungry because they only had  choice of meal and it was inedible to ensure the passengers didnt  any funny ideas and assume that as the vearian option was unavailable they might be given a cracker or a small packet of nuts the cabin crew announced in their uniquely aggressive and dismissive way “you wont  anything else for 12 hours you know” the entertainment is compiled mainly of b movies so i paid £11 for wi notfi so i could watch netflix on my laptop unsurprisingly the signal was so weak i couldnt even send an email to add insult to injury the earbuds provided the cheapest and lowest quality i have ever seen since the last time i used this airline the crew are less rude and obnoxious and are now just impatient and unhelpful  what i dont understand is why it seems that british-airways look for these characteristics as desirable attributes for their crew 
  lhr check in was quick at the first wing and quickly through security the first lounge was quiet for a change and a reasonably good breakfast buffet available while ba have brought british-airwaysck their highlife magazine in the lounge it seems they used covid to scrap all the other magazines they used to offer as part of the endless ba cost cutting the toilets in the lounge were as disgusting as ever not cleaned frequently on this visit and they are about 20 years out of date the public washrooms in t5 are better and cleaner boarding was the usual ba muddled mess and two of the gate staff appeared to have no clue what they were doing endless announcements at the gate about being a full flight requesting passengers to check in british-airwaysgs only to  on a flight that was less than 40% full onboard a very good welcome from captain and the flight left the gate only 5 mins late breakfast had 3 choices and was a fair standard no hot towels or even packet towels offered in club europe any more another part of the relentless ba cost cutting i  not mind but fares are proportionately a lot higher now than pre covid cabin staff service was perfunctory at best not a scrap of recognition for ba gold or oneworld emerald members clear proof that ba really do not care any more breakfast trays cleared 45 mins into the flight and that was the sign for staff to stay in the front galley for the rest of the flight paid £499 for 1 hours wifi and dropped connection for the next 40 mins sad to note that staff service on ryanair is more pro active nowadays priority tagged suitcase came out nearly last at malaga this is standard for ba business class british-airwaysggage handling do not waste your my on club europe standards just keep dropping 
  i  not recommend british-airways at all i tried to call to customer service for 3 times in different days and time and i waited for more than 30 minutes on the ph i ended hanging up they are excusing themselves in the high volume of calls i write an email an i am still waiting for 2 weeks  website is difficult to navigate it is not easy really to have an invoice of proof of receipt or look for another service they sent you online but you do not receive a pdf file so if you need a proof of flight you need to do screenshots and once the flight is flown you have no access to that booking again to reprint any document or try to create a pdf you need to contact with a customer service which i did it online long waiting time and had to wait more than a week to receive it expensive and poor almost inexistent customer service and difficult to use their website an airline that definitely  not recommend it is such a shame that in 2023 they are still in this position and sleeping when they have competitors around
  absolutely horrible experience i booked a ticket from expedia for a british-airways operated flight from madrid to belfast with a changeover at london heathrow the whole itinerary was listed as ba although the madrid to london flight was iberia on jan 22nd london was experiencing cold and fog the iberian flight sat on the tarmac for 2 hours in madrid because of the london weather upon landing in terminal 3 i had to take a bus to terminal 5 the flight was the last flight to belfast for the evening and it had already taken off the ba desk was swamped with people as many people had to spend the night due to the weather the british-airways staff said that we could go book any hotel up to 200 pounds and we  be reimbursed i was british-airwaysrely able to find a room and had to take an expensive cab however when trying to  the reimbursement ba said it was not their problem and that it was iberia's problem iberia said they do not reimburse due to the weather when complaining to ba they said they only market the flight as ba and that they refuse to reimburse absolutely disgusting behavior by the airline to not take any responsibility for a flight that they were using their name to sell it to people but do not want to take responsibility for it did they expect me to take the bus british-airwaysck to terminal 3 their people gave out false information
  this is the worst airline not  thing went right i dont understand how they have got it so british-airwaysd late take off no gate when we arrived bags took over 40 minutes to arrive horrendous
  i will never fly british-airways again to start the plane was over 2 hours late with no weather and no reason given the boarding process was chaotic both in the airport and onto the plane but more importantly although we were in business class it wasnt really business class there were a few aisles —not separated in any way—in which they simply put a tray on the middle seat so that no  sits there and those seats like the rest were extremely cramped and uncomfortable i could not believe they called this business class
  worst aircraft i have ever flown the seats were cramped and uncomfortable considering the flights cost well over &1000each we expected a little space for the my my husbritish-airwaysnds knees were rubbing on seat in front which for a 10 hour+ flight is not acceptable my food was disgusting and inedible both the hot food and the breakfast were vile i  not entertain using ba again ground staff were great its the seating and food on offer that lets the airline down we expected so much more
  i enjoyed my flight the boarding was swift and service was very friendly and professional the food selection was good and i enjoyed the quality the was only  downside  not when we landed there was an issue with ground crew not being ready at t5 so in total from landing to ting the doors open it took 30 minutes i believe the heathrow t5 were having strike action that week
 why do you make it so hard after a so so lounge experience the staff taking care of boarding treated us with disdain bordering contempt it cant be training who  do that it has to be no fear of anything happening the “new” club world suites are a huge step up from the old product and really on deliver comfort and privacy the crew were professional but i personally found the food menu rather odd essentially there was  only main that i could handle and was then told they had ran out i was a few rows in 
  after several delays and canceled flights we finally made it to copenhagen on american airlines and british-airways flights my luggage was destroyed wheels torn off i had to buy new luggage in denmark i made a claim with british-airways to reimburse me but because i didnt have the receipt for my old luggage they  only cover 50% of my new luggage advice have receipts for your old luggage prior to flying so you dont  ripped off like i did
  literally the worst flight of my life after booking tickets toher with my partner we were then separated: ‘sorry the flight is full the flight then took off 45 minutes late  not no apology the trolley service took over two hours and they periodically skipped rows and the response was flippant and rude: ‘whoops not sure how that happened what do you want genuinely appalling from beginning to end might as well fly easy jet  not at least they charge a price commensurate with the poor quality of service not like ba
  i swore i  never fly ba again after they messed me about so much when trying to  to budapest but the times for their flights suited me so i decided to give them another go the flight left on time just about the cabin was clean and the staff friendly there was even complimentary tea/coffee and a breakfast british-airwaysr to be had for economy the flight was pleasant enough and i ca not think of any negatives to write about the flight and service was certainly head and shoulders above my trip with easyjet
  obviously many airlines have g downhill in recent years prices have increased and services have g down the most disappointing thing about ba is that aspects that really dont need to  worse have the check in staff at heathrow are downright rude and abusive shouting at passengers to line here and there and rolling their eyes if passengers  confused with the constant shouting and bullying airlines are now competing globritish-airwayslly more and more and this behaviour is particularly noticeable in asia where the service industry is next level i nt want to suggest that all the staff are like this and many younger employees are polite and helpful however there were a couple of older staff that were downright rude and obnoxious 
 lost 3 out of 4 checked british-airwaysgs denied wheelchair assistance at lhr for my wife and the staff forced us to change terminals by foot rude staff on ba297 from lhr to ord on april 05 2023: ignored multiple times when simply requested a cup of water when walked up to them after a couple of attempts to request for water politely the ba staff onboard yelled at my wife and asked her to be go british-airwaysck to seat horrible flight with disappointing staff customer service is terrible and online check notin never worked because ba never verified our covid documents which were uploaded in advance resulting me and my wife seated separately ive lost respect for british-airways disgusted
  i have flown with ba for many years and there was a time about 10 years ago when they were ting better sadly this trip underlines how they have slipped versus other airlines at booking time  is scammed an extortionate amount to book a seat at heathrow t5 check in the queues were unbelievably long and staff at british-airwaysg drop curt to say the least the lounges here remain awful and overcrowded and ba has not invested in them for many years on the flight the food was okay although portions are kept minimal this was  of those days when the crew could not give a damn and the service was mostly absent for the entire flight next time they change ceo can they not do better than recruiting from aa second rate bud irish airline
 boarding at mumbritish-airwaysi was chaotic and british-airwaysdly organised once on board the crew announcements were professional relaxed and informative in typical ba style the seat was quite comfortable it was a refurbished aircraft and the padding and materials are quite good i was lucky that the middle seat was empty so i didnt suffer from the new narrow seat which i think  have made it a lot less comfortable the ife is excellent responsive and good quality there is an enormous selection of tv and movies and a good number of games wifi is also very good not quite netflix quality but still reasonable and i dont think £1799 for full flight is british-airwaysd value you can pay less if you just want short term simple messaging cabin crew were very good friendly and efficient catering was reasonable although on a near 10hr flight the small but tasty pastry for the second meal service wasnt really enough landing and processing at heathrow was astonishingly quick  not it felt like it was 3am even though it was 6:30pm no queues or waiting at all even the british-airwaysggage was super quick at coming through overall a very solid experience in economy significantly better than it used to be
 mexico city airport is a zoo but taking the late departure on ba to lhr is not too british-airwaysd club passengers can use the aa admirals lounge which is surprisingly good and not too busy as it seems to cater to ba's club passengers only at this time of day lovely staff solid food & british-airwaysr really pleasant we flew an older 787 with the old style club seats seated in the front cabin just 3 rows of club in the window and adjecant aisle seat is really good if you travel with your partner come to think of it i will really miss this old style  notonce cutting edge not lay notout there is no better way to fly when you are a couple we were in that last row of the front cabin so both window and aisle seat had unobstructed access to the aisle still terrible you have to pay for these seats but it obvioulsy works and we were happy ting these seats flying ba when the crew is good is amazing service was impecable on this flight just the right mix of humor service and attention food seemed to be good as well but hardly touched it i am fine sleeping in these old club world seats although bedding could be better on time departure smooth flight and early arrival at heathrow we went outside for a smoke and returned to the terminal through fast track security at lhr has always been terrible but today security staff was too busy chatting among themselves so all british-airwaysgs went through without 'secundary' checks we had a lovely shower at the 'spa' what a fabulous facility the south lounge was crazy busy and it is just a design disaster who ever choose the bizarre combination of furniture: what a mess food on offer was solid and so are the drinks our home stretch to amsterdam was pretty straight forward lousy welcome at the door but crew recovered well and made every feel special with excellent british-airwaysr notcart service i love the 'double' notservings of drinks english tea is about the worst meal concepts in the world and i really do not understand ba stuck to it through the years no not like the cucumber white bread things but hey on time landing in amsterdam but the usual long taxi then clumsy jet bridge connection ended up with a 20 minute late arrival why is it so hard to connect a jetbridge in amsterdam flying club in ba is still wonderful i love it
  very poor service very frustrating firstly my flight to lhr was cancelled on 16 mar23 while i got a text message to inform me the information desk was unable to confirm if was correct or scam once this was confirmed i went to the counter to  my new boarding pass at the counter they informed me that the coach will be leaving in 15mins for the hotel we me and other fellow travelers waited for over 45mins there was no  at the coach stand to guide us or answer any questions the transfer hotel was 30 mins away from the airport when we got to the hotel which is around 10:15pm the staff informed that dinner closes at 10:30 that was a rush it appeared more of a motel than an hotel the room  not was smelling of weed being a non notsmoker this was uncomfortable although i wanted to compromise and rest when i went to wash my face the tap on the sink came off in my hands i panicked and asked the reception staff to change my room after some discussion they agreed to change it i went to the alternate room to my horror it was occupied i asked the staff to call a cab and i left 
  generally poor sent to gate on time sat maybe 30 minutes was then announced as crew were not familiar with the a321 there  be a delay clearly nonsense and there was a retraction on board of this statement watched the crew walk through to the gate my impression was they did not want to be there was given a miniscule amount of water small british-airwaysg of pretzels and then it was announced there  be a wait for any further cabin service as card processing machines were u/s no further updates or sight of crew for next two hours then attempted to charge us for even a glass of water when i said this should be complimentary girl said it was not her problem and walked away
  ba changed our prepaid seats at the last minute and charged us to select new seats flight took off late cabin crew served a tiny packet of pretzels arrived at heathrow late put on a remote stand loaded onto buses to terminal held up at transit security by a clown of a member of staff allowed 15 passengers at a time because of a trial queued at security for 20 minutes 
  flew from london heathrow to marrakech ba changed our pre paid seats at the last minute and even charged us to select other seats boarding was chaos staff were rude demanding selected passengers put their hand luggage in the hold i had  small british-airwaysg however they never demanded other passengers with 2/3 british-airwaysgs and some with hand luggage that was obviously too big flight was late taking off and the snack was a miserable tiny packet of cheese pretzels this airline is going downhill rapidly
 i was meant to fly in january to algeria i paid over £300 for the ticket just a few days before i was meant to fly my wife broke her foot i had to then rebook it in march and pay another £100 i called british-airways 3 weeks before my flight in march and i told them again that it had to me rebooked as my wife was still not well they told me that i dont have to pay anything to  it rebooked as i sent them a letter from the hospital saying my wife wasnt well however they never sent me the ticket they made me wait for nearly 4 weeks and they asked me to pay either £316 on top of the £450 that i paid previously or the second option they gave me is to  a refund of £80 tax only i found it ridiculous that they told me to pay a fraction of the my i previously paid each time i call them they hang up on me; or they continue telling me to pay £360 i made a complaint and nothing happened
  we have flown repeatedly with british-airways and the one world alliance over the last few weeks every flight was delayed now we are british-airwaysck at the airport in miami and have another massive delay so we will miss our connecting flight finally our luggage arrived in puerto rico with a 3 notday delay and we had to reschedule our round trip  we have not received any information about our luggage to this day luckily we checked it ourselves at the airport and it was there the last delayed flight meant the cabin crew that they too miss their connecting flights and we are on the same plane and they ca not do anything  wir sind in den letzten wochen immer wieder mit britisch airways und dem one world zusammenschluss geflogen jeder flug war verspätet nun sitzen wir wieder in miami am flughafen und haben schon wieder eine massive verspätung sodass wir unseren anschlussflug verpassen werden zuletzt ist auch unser gepäck mit 3 tagen verspätung in puerto rico angekommen und wir mussten unseren rundreise umplanen… wir haben bis heute noch keine info über unser gepäck erhalten zum glück haben wir selbst am flughafen nachgesehen und es war da… beim letzten verpspäteten flug meinte die kabinen crew dass auch sie ihre anschlussflüge verpassen und wir im selben flugzeug sitzen und sie können nichts machen 
  i was horrified by the extremely small seats and the poor training that the crew clearly receives not  of them exuded any kind of warmth or expressed any desire to make our journey pleasant the seats were so narrow that regardless of the size of your neighbors you are forced to touch each other constantly if the seat in front of you is reclined you have no choice but to recline your own or else you are breathing in the head/ scalp of the person in front of you food was revolting they do not even provide napkins unless you ask with the pre notmeal drinks and the secondary meal the last time i flew ba it was a completely other experience and i was so sorry to see how far the quality level has slid it was really majorly disappointing and i regret that i have already purchased 2 other intercontinental trips with the company i will now have to see if i can change them the pathetic 250 ml bottle of water it's just a sip on the shorter flights the seats could not even be reclined which was a great pity since the flight was delayed by almost 3 hours and we had to wait on board
"  
the worst cabin experience ever: cramped seats very low cost style and uncomfortable could suit for short flights but not for a 5 hours service catering is also a shame: 250ml of water + a chocolate british-airwaysr for a 5 hours service will never fly ba again "
 first time flying with british-airways and first time flying to the americas from india via london heathrow i chose premium economy at a reasonable price i was quite comfortable however the first leg of the flight from mumbritish-airwaysi to heathrow the plane was a bit outdated and there was only a foot rest the second leg from heathrow to nassau the plane was brand new and my premium economy seat had a pop up leg support which was much more comfortable cabin service was fine  not i appreciated that they did not come through the cabin often while every was sleeping the meals were not that great to be hst after landing in heathrow we had to wait on the tarmac for 45 minutes waiting for an open gate my connection was less than an hour long the ba staff in the heathrow airport helped me move through security quickly and i made it with time to spare for my next flight when i arrived in nassau i found that my luggage did not make it due to the short connection time in london the ba british-airwaysggage representative in nassau was extremely professional and took down my claim my luggage arrived on the next ba flight a few days later and british-airways nassau representative delivered it over to a charter airline which shipped it to the island i was staying on very impressive and efficient
  the latest affront stood in first class line for an hour finally go up front and the ba agent let 4 supposed vips with 12 not14 large to notbe notchecked british-airwaysgs in front of all of us arrogant and unapoloic add this to a long list of post notcovid disappointments we are d with ba
  booked a flight return flight between london and munich for 3/11 to 3/17 in december the return flight was cancelled and re notbooked from 3/17 to 3/12 british-airways only notified me of the first change but not the second getting the flight reinstated took multiple ph calls on both occasions each time needing to find a helpful representative british airway employees told me that even though they cancelled my flight they did not have to refund the ticket they tried to charge an $800 change fee through repeatedly calling british-airwaysck british-airways reinstated my 3/17 flight on 2/20 and then again on 3/6 to make sure it did not  changed again i checked the status of my ticket daily from 3/12 to 3/15 it was intact those days on 3/16 when it was time to check notin for the flight it was g at the airport the staff at the british-airways check notin counter are not ba employees so cannot help resolve problems there are no ba representative at the munich airport the confirmation documentation from british-airways was of no value i was left stranded at the airport
  i tried to check in on line and was informed that this was not possible i was given no reason for this i telephd ba customer service and must have wasted nearly 2 hours being given wrong ph numbers and incorrect information staff need customer training better knowledge of their product and some manners ba customer service was virtually non existent i will never fly with them again
  a catalogue of failures we flew from belfast to heathrow a week ago and the flight was delayed by over three and a half hours we missed our onward air canada flight to calgary as a result on arriving in calgary after re notrouting via vancouver which added over 6 hours to our journey we met other passengers who had also missed the same air canada flight as their british-airways flight from manchester had also been delayed by several hours we are now on our way home only to find our heathrow to belfast flight which had already been cancelled and put british-airwaysck 2 hours is now delayed by another 2 hours avoid british-airways like the plague
"  
our flight out to dubrovnik was at the painful time of 6:30 in the morning and from london gatwick not an easy airport to  to at that hour especially as you have to be at the airport minimum 2hrs before to be ready to board i understand why the likes of easyjet ryanair or wizzair fly at very odd times to utilise cheaper slots at airports but it seems an odd choice for ba given most people like us who fly with them choose them british-airwayssed on quality not on price al outbound lgw notdbv: boarding was fairly quick easy and efficient and we took off on time pilot announcements clear professional and inspired confidence which is something i appreciate and expect of ba pilots aircraft was clean and it had not been through the recent refurbishment program yet so had the advantage of having the 'pinnacle' seats in economy still with more padding and adjustable winged headrests for better comfort complimentary harrogate mineral water given as usual which is a premium touch complimentary snack of a nutrigain british-airwaysr was poor and not premium however cabin crew felt very unpolished in both presentation and behaviour  not messy ill notfitting uniforms and unclassy make notup toilets clean and maintained appreciate anti notbritish-airwayscterial wipes being kept available post notcovid inbound dbv notlgw: for some reason no online or app check notin available despite dubrovnik airport being a very modern airport with state of the art facilities no queue at manual check notin though and ground staff were very warm friendly and helpful pro notactively offered to take our larger hand notluggage into hold free of charge but we decided to keep with us as we  have to dash for train home from airport and trains on the other end were being cancelled already we did not understand the delay to our flight as the inbound flight for that day had took off on time and landed on time also we travelled to dubrovnik out of season and the airport was empty at that hour with all services being available solely for this flight taking off that evening all the passengers in the terminal at that time including us were there to take this flight we boarded on time and then we all sat at the gate for 15 minutes for no reason it's truly bizarre how ba managed to take off late when all the services at the airport were operating and live solely for the purpose of enabling this flight to take off pilots for this flight were unpolished with unclear announcements  not during the flight  could not even remember where we flying british-airwaysck to no apology for delay cabin crew a bit smarter presented and seemed more approachable harrogate water given out and the worlds tiniest british-airwaysg of pretzels complimentary seats for this flight were horrendous and the new 'slimline' s ba are installing from row 14 onwards these seats have british-airwaysrely any padding so very hard and also have no headrests so very hard to  comfortable we landed 55 minutes late in gatwick and again no apology was given  not we were lucky to catch the last uncanceled train home otherwise we'd been stranded for hours we'd spent half an hour circling gatwick because we missed our original landing slot given 7 because in the context of the short nothaul market thats what they deserve  not we fly ba as we do not fly the low notcost carriers after so many british-airwaysd experiences but it's by no measure good just the least british-airwaysd option given 1 point extra solely for giving something complimentary onboard"
  if i could give a minus rating i  supposed to be lhr notams at 1405 on 13th march get to lhr at 1200 email to say flight cancelled no  able to help at lhr said to use the app only halfway sensible option was from lcy notams at 1705 so taxi over there as trains from lhr not working ok not ba's fault get to lcy showing as cancelled on screen so check the app and there it is rebook again via the app to the 1530 departure go to desk to drop british-airwaysg and was told that i was only on standby for the flight with no guarantee of a seat despite the app telling me it was confirmed the 1835 to ams was already overbooked so was moved onto the 1930 flight to rotterdam the 1530 and 1835 were both cancelled anyway as it happened eventually took off and the best thing i can say is that it landed intact return from ams notlhr similar story arrive at ams screen shows the 2100 is cancelled quickly check app and confirmed it was no emails no texts nothing rebooked via app to the 2200 departure so could have been worse desk agent helpfully printed me a boarding card as the app was unable to issue anything for a rebooked flight overall dreadful they just do not care and hide behind apps and automated call centres avoid unless you have no other option and even then stop and consider if you 'really' need to go
 plane was over an hour late leaving no problem that can happen but on arrival at heathrow the plane sits on the runway for 45 minutes as there was no free stand to go to then once at the stand we waited another 45 minutes as there was no bridge available to enable us to  off the plane just pathetically inefficient
  we were flying world traveller plus their premium service what it was not was premium we have travelled with many airlines and lucky enough to fly premium most times ba's premium is the worst i have come across the flight from heathrow to jfk was just ok the flight british-airwaysck was in a plane that should not be used old dirty uncomfortable with two broken seats out of the four we had   not recline and  reclined without using the button ba needs to look at the premium service and offer exactly that instead of trying to cut costs they have fallen far behind their competitors they were once my preferred airline but now i try and avoid at all costs i  rather pay more and fly with some else
  this was literally  of the worst experiences i havent been to an airport since it began in orlando flying british-airwaysck the flight plan system went down and we were stuck on the tarmac for 6 hours poor customer service and just ignored at times then missed my connecting flight and we were told not to leave the british-airwaysggage area without our british-airwaysgs even though i booked through to dublin another 4 hours i was told my british-airwaysgs were lost and to continue to the desk to book a flight another hour later i was handed a card with a number and told to ring it i was cut off three times and told i nt be able to  home that day despite several flights being available just booked my own flight and had lost my suit and presents for christmas and missed an engagement party
  the usual shambolic unfolding that ba has now unfortunately been come to known for we had a long weekend flight booked to munich that was supposed to be departing on 9th february at 19:55 this happened to be our first flight with our newborn 3 month old daughter it turned out to be a horror show of incompetence just under 3hrs before scheduled departure the original 9th february flight was cancelled we received an email as we were boarding the heathrow express id booked a day of holiday off work for this trip we ended up ting doing a round trip to paddington instead on the way british-airwaysck from the cancelled flight both me and my wife tried calling ba despite  of us having silver membership possibly the largest joke of a membership currently out there i took us nearly 45 minutes to speak to some who could help i believe ba outsource their call centres and so you end up talking to people who are following a script the result is that you might as well be speaking to an ai rather than a human we often received the response similar to ‘computer says no if this is the service level for silver members i cant imagine what a regular punter has to put up with when the ph originally connected to a person i had to wait 5 minutes as his computer booted up  not ba then proceeded to auto notbook us onto a new flight for the next day but going to a different destination our original flight was to munich and the auto notbooked replacement flight was to salzburg when asking the robot at the ba call centre why they booked us on a replacement flight to a location 135km apart they couldnt understand my frustration  eventually some was able to book us onto a flight the following day at 17:00 not ideal as id wasted a valuable day off work and the hotel nt refund us or move our booking but at least we were going to munich and not salzburg  not the day of the new flight came round and this time we managed to  all the way to the check in desk upon arriving at the check in desk we were told that our rebooked flight had just been cancelled 4 minutes earlier no email no text no notification ever arrived from ba to tell us that the flight had been cancelled incomprehensible as to how this could have possibly happened the check in person said i should  on the app to rebook at this point i didnt know whether to explode with anger or cry luckily another check in person had an ounce of sympathy and explained to the useless check in person that he could actually rebook us we were booked onto another flight later that evening 19:55  not ba0958 unfortunately that meant 5hrs in the grotty lounge with a 3 month old british-airwaysby it appears that every now has access to a lounge and so theres really no difference between the lounge and a hostel other than you  free stuff in the former this was not a pleasant experience we did eventually arrive in munich and despite asking didnt  our push chair/stroller delivered to the front of the plane the plane was a characteristically ba dumping ground  not they used to give you sanitising wipes so you could clean your seat and tray table down but they seemed to have cut british-airwaysck on this service too all in all another shocking ba service a lost day of holiday and not an an ounce of empathy/sympathy/understanding at all from any of the employees i interacted with
  lost my case and took 6 weeks to locate it and still have not replied to me after 8 weeks i had a business class flight scheduled on dec 12 2022 … manchester > copenhagen  notbangkok and return flight dec 27 2022 … bangkok > stockholm > manchester sas airlines left manchester over an hour late due to the weather and air traffic control when i arrived in copenhagen to  the connecting flight for bangkok we were 10 minutes too late and the flight had g half of the plane missed it sas airlines provided me with a new itinerary the same day being … copenhagen sas > london ba > dubritish-airwaysi emirates > bangkok i returned from copenhagen to london and the collected my boarding pass at ba we were over 2 hours late leaving london due the weather and a passenger being asked to leave the flight we arrived in dubritish-airwaysi late and was informed the flight had g emirates then informed me that i had to speak with thai air to  another flight issued i spent over an hour phoning thai air with nobody picking up the ph i then spoke with thai air dubritish-airwaysi who informed me that they did not have any alternative flights and suggested that i buy a new ticket and then claim the funds british-airwaysck later i paid £127943 for a kuwait airways flight out of dubritish-airwaysi > kuwaiti > bangkok whilst in dubritish-airwaysi i checked with kuwait airlines regards my british-airwaysggage and they informed me that it had not arrived from london and they  locate it and forward to my bangkok address the following day my british-airwaysggage never arrived despite me completing lost british-airwaysggage forms i arrived british-airwaysck home yesterday and was informed by ba that they have found my british-airwaysg in london 
  the incoming and outgoing flight was delayed because french air traffic controllers were on strike so we were routed over germany and not ba's fault o arrival the pilot announced we could not pull onto the stand as no ground crew had showed up to turn on the automatic last metre guidance it took around 40 minutes to find some then when that was d there was a further delay as there were no ground staff to operate the skybridge all told we were trapped on the plane for over an hour within metres of our gate total disruption wasted time absolutely no excuse for this
  back in december my family and i as we were ting onto the plane were refused even though we had boarding passes and seats allocated and had booked 6 months in advance we were refused it turns out that some had not turned up to work and they could not let all the passengers on the plane so quite randomly not 9 people were selected and turned away we were selected as we had no check in luggage and it was easier to boot us off despite them not knowing my circumstances if i had connecting flights in london etc i sought compensation from ba which i was told i could do and what an absolute nightmare this process has been they  not acknowledge my complaint for my family until i had an authorisation letter from them saying i could act on their behalf even though i booked and paid for the tickets so i uploaded the authorisation letter no less than 10 times every time they told me they received it and every time i followed it up they told me they had not there was no other way except to post from australia to the uk to some office eventually it finally go through to them i have now chased up the reimbursement four times each time they tell me it has been sent and to be patient today they tell me that they need to check my account details so again i send them the same information that i have d before and i wait patiently for my reimbursement i am convinced that their business model is for you to  so frustrated you just go away well you know what i wo not
  as usual the flight is delayed this week it already 3 hours and im held on a bus waiting to  taken to the plane i really cant explain how much i detest british-airways if it was a cheap bud airline i could accept it but its premium prices for the most unreliable service
 a short ba euro trip and this is where ba excel clean aircraft good crew professional on time within lhr standards and a good value product delivered pity the in flight food sales were not a bit more exciting and appealing as more than a few asked about the non existent hot food options but good overall check in self service is great now once you know how to use it with plenty assistance on hand for those who cant
  we are flying business class for most of our flight and then premium economy for the british-airwayslance in addition to the plane tickets we paid an additional $225/pp for our seats now ba is changing planes they arbitrarily put us in separate seating areas my wife & i when we were sitting toher before and they want to charge  of us additional $$ to be re notseated next to each other  they moved our seats away from each other and we should not have to pay for their change of planes and their decision to not have us sitting toher we have not even flown yet this airline is horrible
  i am in australia and on friday night went online to book a flight from heathrow to malpensa milan i did not realise that when i specifically searched for flights to malpensa it offered options to other airports in milan when i received my itinerary by email it was to another airport in milan the itinerary email did not provide any means of contact for changes or advise me of the 24 hour cooling off period as it was the weekend here i was unable to reach their office until monday when they advised me there was no refund other than fees as i had missed the 24 hour cooling off period apparently as the ticket was issued in the uk i needed to contact them i have now cancelled the ticket and i will be going out of my way in the future to avoid flying british-airways
  at 754 am on the day of travel whilst driving to london heathrow i received an email advising my flight had been cancelled i was offered an alternative flight with american airlines which i had no alternative but to accept as i must travel today i was flying to la to see a family member who is end of life the american airlines desk downgrade my cabin from premium economy to economy tried 3 times ba provide teleph number total useless no help given me wrong email address for sending my complains given to me in the email i have been a ba frequent flyer for decades and have been a loyal customer i now find i am travelling 11 hours in economy without even the possibility of a refund let al an upgrade this is completely unacceptable what has happened to this company i have had better treatment from ryanair
  would happily fly them again i had a personal emergency and was allowed to reschedule my flights free of charge onboard service on lhr notist was no frills but jfk notlhr was impeccable: good food lots of movies/cds on the ife open british-airwaysr service the entire flight friendly flight attendants always happy to provide an extra drink/snack
  flew premium only worth the extra my for the bit of extra room penny pinching means theres no other benefit  not  drink service on 10 hour flight no fizz offered before take off poor food boarding was british-airwaysdly organised food left on tables 30 min before landing with no tea and coffee offered few small cups of water passed around but nothing “premium” about this new planes have been decorated terribly  not feels like youre in a dentist waiting room devoid of any personality or joy only fly if the only option only fly premium if its not too expensive  not seriously not worth much more than economy these days especially if youre in the middle 4
  first our morning flight was cancelled and moved to an afternoon flight understanding sometimes these situations are unavoidable however it lost us  day's experience in cairo we were quite upset when we got onto the plane and were squashed into regular seats on both flights as my husbritish-airwaysnd had spasms he had to stretch his legs across my lap and not once did any of the attendants ask if we were okay as we were clearly struggling as the service came to us for food each choice we made we were told they were all out and we had to settle for what they had left i did the correct thing once home and sent in my complaints they responded with a $100 pound voucher for our group
  although it was a bit uncomfortable flight in an economy the flight attendants made the flight the best possibly could  such a nice and professional crew very attentive and looking out for their customers
  boarding was decently organised the a380 still has the rather strange configuration in club world where you neighbour is sitting in the opposite position the a380 was nearly full rather poor amenity british-airwaysg the welcome drink was ok but then rather long waiting for the aperitive what is made in the pantry the meal was ok but not great aside the champagne no european wines on this flight service was friendly but rather slow no spontaneous refills of drinks offered acceptable continental style breakfast extremely narrow restrooms without any lotions or similar it was an acceptable experience nothing more after landing 50 minutes waiting for luggage labelled as priority
 boarding on time and departure on time for a flight to london heathrow that is very ok the a320 with rather narrow seats in business light meal a caesars salad a mousse as sweet and choice of drinks  not nothing wrong for such a short flight fa's were very friendly and landing on time
  my original flight was cancelled just over 2 weeks before my actual flight and although alternative flights were available british airways affected the trip i planned it feels like ba is doing a favour to passengers rather than being paid to deliver the service
  delayed just for a change poor communication british-airways sells premium prices flight tickets and delivers no better than a low cost airline customer service is impossible to contact and it seems ba tries hard to hide any possible email communication address when it's available
  very competent check in staff saw had a problem with my left arm and insisted i could not take exit seat moved me to row 30 where the middle seat was empty on the other hand on board  not huge line for toilets  not 45 min into a 230 min flight a crew member realised  of the toilets is closed  not as crew had put their luggage there they announced that they could not serve hot drinks on this flight and to bear with them as service will be slow on asking why: they did not give us enough cups for hot drinks and the card machine is not working so we have to fill out each credit card slip a bottle of water and a nutrigrain british-airwaysr 
  check in was so slow no self check in and british-airwaysg drop boarding was ok flight totally full booked row 9 which was ok some space in overhead bins seat and legroom ok cabin crew ok smiled gave out the bottle of water and pretzels flight itself was ok landed 25 mins early and then waited 30 minutes for a stand and ground crew bags came off reasonably quickly ba still seems to believe it is something special a premium carrier the reality is that it is not the only reason we flew ba was we got virtually free tickets because both flights were cancelled last year ba is our carrier of last choice
  my review relates to the appalling experiences i had with british-airways on 14th february 2023 i was due to travel to madrid with british-airways and before setting off i heard on the radio that there were flight delays i looked at the heathrow airport website and saw that my flight had been cancelled as a result of the information on the website i called british-airways and have 26 minutes on hold i found myself speaking to somebody in a call centre in south africa the person was hard to understand due to a heavy accent and he was incompetent and insisted that the flight was not cancelled i made my way to heathrow and sure enough the flight was indeed cancelled the woman in question had the audacity to declare that the flight was cancelled and that “there are no facilities here at the airport to rebook you” she refused to let me and about 12 other people join the queue for the clearly marked assistance desk the same woman and  of her colleagues gave out a card with a teleph number and told  rather elderly gentleman to “go online to rebook your seat” i am visually impaired and found the attitude of the ba employee to be appalling i called the number on the card the employee gave me and was again in a long queue to a call centre the person who picked up the ph kept me waiting 22 minutes and declared that the flight was not cancelled and that the airport “must be wrong” he then in a flippant t said he was just informed that the flight was indeed cancelled and that i  have to go and speak to iberia customer services in heathrow to rebook i took the elderly gentleman with me to iberia where the counter staff member rolled her eyes in disgust and said that it was nothing to do with iberia i returned to ba and this time i joined the check notin line and told a check notin agent what had happened the man in question booked me onto the next available flight within a matter of a few minutes he gave me a £30 voucher as a form of compensation but said he could not add my frequent flyer number with a partner airline the voucher proved useless i am afraid as various shops in the predepature area refused to accept it and although i was told i could use it after clearing security n of the shops  accept it once aboard my new flight the service was minimal other than a tiny bottle of water and a packet of pretzels nothing else was available this was a full flight as so many people had been transferred from the cancelled flight ba cabin crew announced that any additional items other than the small bottle of water and pretzels had to be ordered via their skyshop
 this was my first time flying with ba & i was pleasantly surprised islamabritish-airwaysd via doha was very comfortable and the crew were great friendly and helpful the second flight was operated by qatar airways this was from doha to islamabritish-airwaysd my return journey was a direct ba flight 46kg luggage allowance was really generous and stopped the hassle with connecting flights crew on this flight were really nice too what let ba down was the food it really was not nice the ife could do with some more content but that's not really a huge issue
  lots of cancellations and delays and no  apologized edinburgh to london on feb 14th 2023 our original flight was cancelled and the rebooked  was cancelled as well the third rebooked  was supposed to departure at 12:50 and had several delays until 2:24 then we had to wait 57 minutes for our luggage to arrive
 ba 242 on the 6/2/23 boarding was delayed due to late arrival from the incoming flight communication from the ground staff was excellent and keep us informed in flight services were excellent the crews were friendly with excellent service overall very happy with ba
  not only my first flight in 17 years but also my first time british-airwaysck to england for 17 years i flew from pmi notlgw on 21/01/2023 and returned on 29/01/2023 both wizz air and easyjet offered very inconvenient flight times and charged more than the flights were worth for british-airwaysggage british-airways were the most convenient and best value option available they offered ideal flight times and the €18 charge per flight for british-airwaysggage was very reasonable  not total cost for both flights was €126 +/ not regular update information via email seamless online seat allocation and check in efficient staff at the check in desks at pmi and lgw ensured that long queues were dealt with as quickly as humanly possible immaculate aircraft comfortable leather seats with adequate legroom i'm 6'4 tall cabin crew were polite friendly and professional in flight food and drinks were good quality and reasonably priced i enjoyed the meat ploughman's and ipa beer €10  not/+ total on both flights i have flown 80+ times in the last 50 years with different airlines on various propeller and jet aircraft as well as  lgw notlhr helicopter transfer flying was a totally different experience 'british-airwaysck in the day' we are now in the age of the 'bud airline' nostalgia aside british-airways are the best airline i've flown with
  my husbritish-airwaysnd and myself were flying to madrid on the 3rd of february for a legal matter and we had to be in madrid by 13:00 pm we had booked our flight and car with ba holidays unfortunately we chose a parking we had never used before we got lost and missed our 6:00 am flight to madrid i tried to stay calm cold head and we went to british-airways to  help the first lady that we spoke to asked if we had d the booking with ba holidays we did not know that she gave us a number to call and told us that she could not do anything else that we had to call that number we called the number which was asking us to call another  number which we did and there the message was that opening hours were from 8 am till 4 pm we went british-airwaysck to the lady and explained that we could not wait until 8 am but she told us that she could not do anything i did reach out to another staff  a lovely young lady called althea she started to look at it made several calls went to check with some else to an office she managed to  some to send me a text message that i had to call and that got answered and the other lovely lady on the line modified our booking to place us in the following flight at 730 am they did not charge us for that our car reservation and flight british-airwaysck were maintained and we made it to madrid without the support of the lovely althea her professionalism her care for us we  not have make it she was so sweet so caring but at the same time so determined to help she for sure went above and beyond her role and her responsibilities
 organised boarding process really friendly crew quick drink and a snack all in all a great experience the crew are a credit to ba the best crew in europe
  outward journey ba245 london to buenos aires club world 10 january 2023 our experience was poor from beginning to end although we had reserved seats 11f and 12j another passenger was occupying 11f and crew made no attempt to address the problem eventually i persuaded the passenger to move and occupy her designated seat 11d we boarded punctually but were not offered drinks when i asked for a drink the crew member said it was too late and blamed the seating problem the same crew member then began taking orders for dinner but did not write them all down and gave up after a few minutes for the safety briefing she asked us to repeat our orders later the hot flannels smelled musty and felt old and ragged  one of the crew wondered aloud whether my companion and i were related  my soup was cold i was told it was served from flasks was that an explanation or an excuse my coffee was weak and tasted like instant granules my companion was initially served no bread roll with dinner the breakfast menu stated a 'selection of rolls/pastries' but there was no choice and my companion was given a dried fruit pastry where he  have chosen a bread roll  although we had not previously asked for or been offered any other than those supplied at the seat small bottles of water ran out return journey ba244 buenos aires to london heathrow world traveller plus 26 january 2023 was a huge contrast from the warm welcome on boarding to crews professionalism throughout its a poor reflection on club world service that our experience in world traveller plus was so much better and kinder weighed against the advantages of a flat bed the considerable price difference was not worth paying for the catalogue of errors and inconveniences outlined above
 check in agent at lhr was very helpful and friendly as were the in flight crew seat was comfortable with good leg room however the food was poor  not british-airwaysrely better than economy class with a poor quality and limited selection of wine in flight entertainment selections were very limited far inferior to what ba used to offer overall this premium economy product was disappointing and very poor value for my
  very disappointing i book ba so i can fly during the day my return flight at 6pm on 28/1/23 was cancelled replaced by a flight at 9pm it took off 1/2 hour late meaning i arrived at gatwick well after midnight with no onward transport connections i had to pay £70 for a taxi home plus the seats are really snug im only 57” but my knees were hitting the seat in front no more ba for me they are trading on their name but the customer service and reliability has deteriorated ryanair has better aircraft and take notoff slots
 excellent service both on the ground and on board  not while their first class product might not be leading edge the service around the entire experience was well worth the cost of the ticket the concorde room at heathrow is well managed and a great place to relax prior to the trip flight was slightly delayed out of heathrow but arrived on schedule in johannesburg
  good lounge at cape town on time departure drinks high quality sound dinner service breakfast reasonable arrival lounge was good but showers cold
  a really excellent journey lounge not overcrowded in late afternoon plenty of edible food easy boarding new club world suites great and compared to when we last travelled in them a year ago food and drink british-airwaysck to previous standards not choice of individual wines rather than bland blends courses served individually with cut glass and china beef cheek really tasty as was a surprisingly good soup crew excellent good choice of movies breakfast after a good night's sleep not fruits etc first could not manage the full english which was offered arrival on time what more could you want not quite up to gulf standards overall but ba seems to have eventually got its business class british-airwaysck to standard
  this flight was  of the worst i have ever had in my life i wanted to pamper myself so i bought business class i was looking forward to my new experience i will not mention the chaos of changing gates several times as these things may happen what surprised me was the lack of attention to passengers the flight was delayed by almost 3 hours even though staff offered vouchers we had no idea where to  them and we were told that we only had about 10 minutes to use them because boarding had already begun firstly i did not see any with the voucher and secondly even if we got it we were not able to use it when i finally got to the airport there was another waiting for about 30 minutes after cross check meantime we were told that due to problems they did not load any food so the flight will be without any food on board the only food offered and given to every on the plane was a small british-airwaysg of nuts as a business class passenger i was offered drinks only all in all my business class contained 3 small glasses of juice   i received no apology or compensation from the company at all it was a disgraceful and cheap service for a very expensive price 
 it seems that there is a race to the bottom amongst airlines i cannot even check in because ba requires the submission of documents for covid restrictions however the form to start the submission process is hopelessly broken after clicking submit the form just hangs forever no error message is given i tried three different browsers on three different devices all have the same hang which means you cannot check in online nor can you select a seat i tried using the chat bot but after 30 minutes of clicking try again i thought i had donated enough time to ba 
  as a spanish born individual living in england i have been using british-airways for over 3 decades multiple times a year on 12th january 2023 i booked a flight for my son and i to go to alicante however i was informed on the 17th january 2023 by my doctors that i am unable to fly due to an elbow operation i have had as a result i decided to give my ticket to my daughter calling up the customer service team for british-airways to make the change on the 18th january 2023 they took my enquiry call there seemed to be some speech delay in the call which presented a small bit of difficulty however i also struggled to understand the support staff member on top of this delay when requesting to change the name on  of the tickets to my daughters name i was told this is not within the policy and that i  need to cancel the ticket and rebook it i was encouraged to divide the booking so myself and my son were on two different booking reference numbers i accepted this and was then asked if i  like to cancel the booking i insisted i  need to know the total of the refund its lucky i did ask to check this as i was then informed it  be roughly £900 the total cost of my booking was £39464 which comes to £19732 per passenger leaving my refund total at less than 3% of the value of my purchase this is despite the seat not be abritish-airwaysndd according to ba  policy all i am entitled to out of a simple change of name is less than 3% refund even when im buying the ticket right british-airwaysck then and there on the ph probritish-airwaysbly for more my than it was worth a week ago
  a rather empty and quiet flight to tel aviv very friendly cabin crew and due to the emptiness of the flight i had an entire row to myself which allowed me to work easily and have as much space as required unfortunately upon landing the breaks overheated and we had to wait for the fire crew to cool them down which delayed us otherwise an overall excellent flight on ba's part this was the first time i have flown this flight and it has actually taken off at the correct time
  easy check in and staff member was polite and helpful and made a specific point of acknowledging our loyalty to ba security at london was fast galleries north was fine and showers were good organised flight boarding plane was fine with good crew and new club world product my wife had a damaged storage area but otherwise ok after take off there was a good drinks and food service which was well run slept well on time arrival we both found the new seat design harder to sleep in
  being a silver flyer and booking a flight through ba to dublin you  have thought i could use the lounge even though ba used air lingus for the flight travelled recently there with the same situation and was allowed in by a kind gentleman at the desk even though he said i had to be gold  he was really accommodating and it wasnt a big deal but the two ladies on the desk were like no no empathy there at all notsaying the other guy shouldnt have let me and they will have a word with him  come on ba i booked the flight through you and you made me fly with air lingus so you should let me use the lounge as a silver flier 
  i find ba incredibly tacky and constantly looking for ways to  my out of customers i have travelled using major airlines my whole life and although i know it sounds silly  not when on a 4 hour flight on a major airline you do expect some form of beverage or snack as a curtesy and a port to charge your ph and not have to pay insane prices for luggage there was no inflight entertainment and the aircraft was very snug when i challenged why i had to pay for my own drink and why no inflight entertainment  not i was told it was a short haul fight my sisters met me from cairo which is an hour and half flight and flew egyptair and somehow received luggage allowance drinks food and inflight entertainment as well as a usb port to charge their phs ba i now realise stands for bud airline staff were great  not what you got for your my not so much
  flew atl to lhr 8th jan 2023 was unlucky enough to be on board a 23 year old 777 refit gave it a decent ife screen and the seat looked decent although combine the ife with the cheap and nasty earbuds and any movie can be ruined headrest was great just a pity little padding is used on the seat as my wife and i were very uncomfortable the leg room in general is poor especially when passengers keep their seat reclined from start to finish zero room aircraft was tired rubber spacers falling out silic sealer falling apart in the toilets toilet seats old stained rubber on arm rest was hanging off no post take off drinks/snacks offered  meal was sent out after a couple of hours was poor chicken cubes that reminded me of dog food mashed potatoes that were purified within an inch of their life stale rock hard roll salad which was rice and carrots dried crackers with no cheese kids meal was just as sad tiny leaf salad with enough dressing to refloat a shipwreck coffee creamer was given with the kids meal snack was decent for the adults british-airwaysgel with cheese and egg hot and tasty kids snack was a green wrap with spinach and onions in it  very very poor mix the food ba service with a grunt being crammed into a seat for 7 hours landing at a remote stand and enduring a bus to the terminal and ba in my opinion is terrible this flight was so disappointing other than  great member of cabin crew everything else was just average
"  great thing about british-airways a380 is the economy section upstairs get this if you can as it allows you to have small stowage cupboards at the window seats despite being not very old the a380 looked tired inside broken side stowage a seat that reclined uncontrollably and slow to react ife the food was supposed to be christmas dinner 3 wafer thin bits of dry turkey 4 over cooked sprouts and some cubed potatoes poor in taste and quality mousse desert was great though slight issue during the snack meal ordered a childs option which was marked as such regular meal arrived as well and they were exactly the same asked a crew member to be told the difference was the sticker on the box staff were ok couple decent but mostly just ok overall ba just seems a tad cheap these days great to sit upstairs but that was where the enjoyment ended just seemed a bit dull and like ba are just an average airline

 the staff are friendly the plane was cold we were shivering they gave light blankets but they were not enough meals were british-airwayssic entertainment was british-airwayssic luggage is delayed today is day 6 and ba staff over the ph say call after 72 hours tracking system is very vague had to extract information from staff that they arrived to vancouver on jan 2nd i offered to collect british-airwaysggage but very vague answer call the airport asked her for ba ph number at yvr but she said we do not have a ph number for you to call call the main airport their policy states you can make a claim only after 21 days
 probritish-airwaysbly the worst business class experience i've ever had on an airline just a few of the issues: required to purchase seats on international club world business class this was not made known during the ticket purchase process and cost me an additional $600 on a single leg lhr notlax for a family of four given the very strange business class seating layout on ba a380s leaving the seat selection to change could have been disastrous for my family ridiculously long boarding times on even small aircraft on my vie notlhr leg the boarding time for the a320 was over 50 minutes long leading to a delayed departure there was no urgency on the part of staff to speed up the boarding times severe overcrowding in the boarding area in satellite c of terminal 5 at heathrow boarding staff  not allow passengers to enter the roped off queue area before boarding i have no idea why not and so crowding was extreme the overall boarding area was far too small for an a380 and i believe this satellite was designed and built after the first a380s were delivered online check notin in advance of flights appears to be completely broken i was urged repeatedly on the ba website and via email and text to upload my covid documents even though at the end of 2022 there are no covid documents required for travel after i filled in british-airwayssic contact information on the website  not and did not upload any covid documentation  not i was informed several hours later that my covid documents have been verified i then received another text message urging me to upload my covid documentation on the vie notlhr leg the shopbritish-airwayscom page that  is directed to after attempting to connect to wifi on the plane indicated ridiculously incorrect remaining flight times  not over six hours and then four hours just before landing ba lounges for club europe and club world at heathrow are often seriously overcrowded furniture and carpeting and other finishes in the clubs are worn or dirty that said the food in the lounges was of pretty good quality the food quality in ba lounges at heathrow may be the only redeeming thing about this airline onboard food and beverage service was far below average for international business class terrible  might say on the lhr notlax leg there was no pre notmeal beverage service and there were no mid notflight beverage services at all unlike most business class offerings on other airlines there was no taking a meal order by flight attendants at the beginning of the flight meals were brought out haphazardly shortly after take off with the chicken or fish type of meal selection similar to economy class there was no coffee or tea service after meals food quality was poor with the pre notlanding snack of a ploughman's lunch being downright disgusting  there was no beverage or british-airwaysr set notup in the galley areas  not beverages available to passengers during the flight  not as is standard on most international business class offerings even bottles of water seemed be hidden away requiring  to ask the flight attendants for water i wo not comment on the bizarre seating layout on the a380 as others have rightly panned the awkwardness and extremely poor design of the seating the seats are not 6' 2 long as stated on the ba website and i found the seats too short for my 6' 2 height the priority luggage tags were not followed in the british-airwaysggage delivery
 definitely not recommended especially for business class the seats are ridiculous and small the food is mediocre if that and good luck with the internet even if you pay for full internet for the entire flight the service however has been great my attendant saved me from crying i dont know who designed this aircraft but in this expensive business class in order to move out of you middle seat to go to the british-airwaysthroom you must rudely climb over the persons legs sitting in the aisle seat your seat is like an enclosed tiny cubicle with no storage space ive unfortunately traveled british-airways business class at least 4 times within the last 4 months never again unless there is no other choice by the way the business class lounge south at heathrow is a cattle pen
  ba shuttle service across the uk is still surprisingly a good product when compared with ba long haul that doesnt always  the best of comments at times its reasonable priced works well fresh crews and no queues or long distances to walk i dont know why they still offer a covid style bottle of water and snack when just stretching to a cup of tea and snack  be great add on for this service currently they have an on line sky cafe but its too fiddly to work or  connected in short trips
 i must admit like many others i tend to avoid ba long haul where possible due to the many poor reviews but had my first ride on a ba a380 the other day so it was an exception what can i say aircraft immaculate and economy seat really comfortable but thats about it ife didnt work but wasnt that interesting anyway i got the map screenshot for a while lunch was poor quality but plenty of nice white wine and other alcoholic drinks made up for it cabin crew pleasant but poor grooming lets them down some skirts some trouser suits some long sleeves some short some jackets some waistcoat some cardigans on at time and all in all they could have d better i think baggage delivery was really quick summing up well i am still not coming british-airwaysck to ba not yet maybe the old charm will return soon
  when will ba update their business class cabin  not 8 across on a 777 it is not so much travelling facing british-airwaysckwards as it were but the cabin staff having to pass food trays across the front of passengers paying business class fares as for having to pay to reserve a specific seat  not an antiquated idea the cabin staff were fine food acceptable check notin ok and business lounge breakfast acceptable the lack of space in the seating area small screen and disfunctional entertainment equipment disappointing having to step over the reclining passengers feet is not attractive 
  paid £200 day before flight for an upgrade from economy to premium economy at checkin they could not find my booking so a little wait while they rang some who explains on the upgrade you  deleted from the system the checkin agent sees took about 5 minutes to resolve seat was nice enough stowage pocket in front a bit small food was reasonably nice shame that the british-airwaysthroom is all the way british-airwaysck through economy and there is a bit of a queue ife system is good but selection mediocre worst part of the flight is that at cpt so we were on a remote stand and bussed in through passport control quickly but then it took an absolute age to  our luggage which ruined what  otherwise have been a reasonable flight upgrade was worth it at £200 maybe £300 its a long flight but their offers of £2000 or whatever for premium economy is comedy pricing score before the luggage fiasco  have been 7 or 8 / 10 with the luggage fiasco i ca not rate it more than 4/10
  ba website did not work weirdly deleted my flight from upcoming flights on the day of departure chaos at cape town airport with hundreds queuing as the computers were down chaos at the gate / no queue management for premium passengers very nice new a350 with smart new club suite champagne warm cabin crew said its impossible to serve it cold which is not true as air france manage it disappointing meal wine served so late after the food you have finished by the time it arrives cheese ice cold and tasteless why ca not the champagne / white wine be in the fridge used for the cheese good ife system but mediocre film selection disappointing breakfast overall: 3 / 10 flew air france business the month before which was way better so sad what's become of ba
  absolutely terrible experience with british-airways after a short flight from london heathrow to frankfurt they could not  my suitcase to me in time for my next flight on cathay pacific to melbourne despite a 3 hour gap between the two flights told me they  arrange for the suitcase to be transferred directly to melbourne  not instead it got to hong kong and left there when they finally tracked it down they sent it british-airwaysck to london all happened over christmas so very stressful yet minimal communication from their team while the plane crew may be lovely the service outside of this has been nothing short of dreadful and if given the option i will avoid flying with them in future
  vancouver to delhi via london we were booked to fly from vancouver to new delhi via london heathrow on dec 22nd we received an email on dec 20th informing us about the industrial action in the uk i called to find out how it may impact our travel the representative kind of scared us of being possibly stranded during our travel and offered us a full refund we called again to confirm about other options but he did not offer any other solutions we asked to cancel our tickets and he told us about the cancellation fee we booked new tickets with another airline with double the cost as our trip was urgent simultaneously he told us he no longer can cancel our tickets on the system but promised us he will make it happen because he told us we   a full refund he processed the cancellation 5 hours later he emailed us that the tickets couldnt be cancelled and suggested we cancel our new tickets once he found out they were with another airline we lost $1000 from cancelling the new tickets now the representative claimed that he never said there wont be any services available and asked us why we were worrying about the industrial action and that other “arrangements” will be made if there were any issues this was new information never given to us before we kept our british airway tickets the next day we asked to speak with the manager and report that we were misguided about the whole situation we never heard british-airwaysck from the manager as we logged in to check notin 15 hours before take off we found that our van — lhr flight was cancelled due to the british-airwaysd weather in vancouver we did not receive any emails from the airport nor the airline about this change we called ba again and asked about rearrangements for our flight to which they offered rebooking with an additional $700 not1000 per person price difference and the dates offered were about 7 days after our original flight was supposed to leave additionally to cancel the rest of the flights with them which we could not reach since our first flight was cancelled we had to pay about $1000 cancellation fee to  a refund we were very frustrated with the overall experience and no accommodations nor accountability as they wanted to charge us for any service or changes possible we were on the ph for 15 hours while other flights that we could have booked were ting sold out  not the customer service person  take 15 not20 minutes for real to search up each question or option we asked about it has been a frustrating experience  not we lost time and my and it ruined our holidays completely we then demanded to speak to the manager who again did not want to take any accountability for their team and gave us a small discount on the cancellation fee in total we were on the ph with them for 2 days british-airwaysck and forth without any resolutions we felt misguided and misinformed with their unfair policies towards their customers we did not feel taken care of at all we had to pay the price for the misinformation and the flights we did not cancel ourselves after all this trouble we spent christmas without our family and the missed the urgent reasons we were travelling for 
  old a320 with narrow pitch flight perfectly on time with constant announcements from cockpit friendly staff free chips and water quick luggage delivery at t5
  another ba shambles started off well with excellent check in at first at t5 mid afternoon so avoided the early morning evening scrum into the concorde lounge excellent service again great choice of cocktails wine etc food ok a bit overcooked but pretty reasonable called to the boarding gate chaos people jostling for position to  on the plane people with children under 5 called before the 8 people in first british-airwaysnkrolling the flight and most of them well over 5 we  on to be told that n of the lights in first can be dimmed at all so the lights were on all night it was like being detained and interrogated excellent wine and champagne selection dinner menu handed out ill have the prawn cocktail to start please no you wont as theyve only loaded  for 8 people and the guy in 1a got it i bet he felt like hed won the lottery ok ill have the beef wellington british-airwayssically a freezing slice of beef with some lettuce mains  ill have the curry no you wont as theyve substituted that with christmas dinner  im going to the maldives to  away from christmas i ended up with short ribs that were inedible no salad starter no water offered no bread roll i just couldnt eat it so british-airwayssically my husbritish-airwaysnd and i have spent £20000 on 2 return seats to be blinded by lights on and left starving no apologies watch out ba as virgin start flying direct in october as always you rest on your laurels and treat your customers like idiots
  ba cancelled my flight home to heathrow on dec 19th on the face of it that was sensible as the weather in iceland was appalling however what was not acceptable was that the flight was cancelled only 4 hours before take off time by which time i was already struggling through dreadful driving conditions to  to the airport i got nowhere near before the conditions became too british-airwaysd if they had taken advice they  have spared every the need to try and travel on roads that all ended up closed i am now booked onto the flight on the 21st and downgraded for my sins having checked today as i type they have not cancelled the flight on the 20th despite the road to keflavík being closed do they not check these things any help from ba offered  not not really
  ba cancelled my flight home the last flight of the day into heathrow and tried to push me onto another flight to london city 3 hours later my car was at heathrow i did not want to try and cross london late at night on public transport with luggage especially as there were rail strikes announced around that time i had to book a flight home with lufthansa which cost €500 for an economy seat but at least it got me home to heathrow all be it another terminal on the friday night so i could  home to family i still have had no news on a refund of the €500 2 months on it's such a shame flying ba used to be such a pleasurable experience ba have cancelled or moved  leg of every journey we've booked this year we are regrettably have to use other airlines now which have much better reliability and customer service
 turned up 35 hours in advance terminal 5 at london heathrow was already carnage 100s of people trying to check in only 5 desks manned long queues at security due to only 4 lines open people stressed pushing shouting and flight delayed by 2 hours according to pilot delay due to suitcases all needing to be loaded missed connecting flight in doha 12 hours wait til next  received a voucher approx £6 for the whole day arrived 1 day later my suitcase didnt arrive with me filed a claim at the desk for 5 days no update no information no offer of compensation and no solution offer i now have a spoilt holiday many personal belongings are g xmas gifts missing extensive expenses i dont know if i will be reimbursed beware with ba expect low level or zero customer service old planes and zero help if anything goes wrong or missing i will personally avoid ba in future at all costs
  boarding – at gate at lgw they called group 1 to board we were world traveller plus & group 3 then called any in groups 2 not6 whereupon every else surged forward why have numbered boarding groups if you dont use them cabin crew  not treated passengers as an inconvenience as they moved about the plane at  point a passenger was coming out of the toilet as a crew member approached and the crew member just pushed the door closed pushing them british-airwaysck into the toilet as they went past and without even a word no acknowledgement when you stood aside to let them past service – we were in the final row of six in wt+ which has a total of 48 seats the lunch meal was brought out and we were the last people to be served not unusual for british-airwaysck row seats but when it came to us there was only the vearian option left of the 3 menu options cabin steward said that they had only been given 48 wt+ meals there was a second hot meal served before we landed again the same server got to us last and again there was only a vearian option left i asked if it might not have been possible to commence serving this second meal from british-airwaysck to front so that we had a choice for at least  meal and she said she hadnt thought of that food – some of it was inedible vearian cannelloni had pasta so thick and uncooked neither of us could eat it the bread roll was crispy like toast in the bottom half and soft in the top half only thing i could eat was the baby bel in between meal snacks consisted of a 2 biscuit pack of shortbread pretty british-airwayssic drinks – they ran out of red wine 4 hours into an 11 nothour flight toilets – there was no toilet accessible directly from the wt+ section we had to walk halfway down the plane through economy to reach a shared toilet we flew virgin atlantic 2 months before in equivalent premium economy and it was so much better organised boarding sparkling wine or orange on boarding water or orange in ba food options available even in last row seats better food proper glasses/cups for drinks dedicated toilet access help yourself snacks helpful service from cabin crew we will not be looking to fly ba over virgin in future
  missing british-airwaysggage customer service was the worst ive ever experienced i arrived british-airwaysck in phoenix on sunday evening and air tags showed my british-airwaysgs arrived on monday but it took three more days before they were finally delivered i understood that due to delays caused by freezing fog in london my luggage did not make it onto my final flight i filled out the required form at the phoenix airport and then attempted to fill  out online where i received a message saying that the british-airwaysgs had already been reported missing and to enter the tracking code that had been sent to me via email but no email was received i made ph calls daily and was told a message was sent and i should hear british-airwaysck within 24 hours finally the email with the tracking number was received on tuesday night i went online with the tracking number on wednesday and it requested that i provide the same information that i had given them on the form at the airport my luggage was finally delivered on thursday afternoon 
  british-airways are not the flag carrier they used to be the check notin staff at the club europe area did not display any premium service and did not provide a good overall service  the galleries south lounge was very busy but the food was very good there is a good array of salads pasta bread and hot food available the festive turkey and ham pie was particularly good the flight was delayed as lhr was very busy on a tuesday evening the boarding process was stressful due to the lack of any queue management system and the majority of passengers congregating around the gate despite ba using a group system to board it took almost 1hr to board 240 passengers the flight itself was good with a good club meal service the british-airwaysr service was good but it seems that ba have d away with champagne on notboard and also in the lounge a menu is handed out prior to departure with a good food offering for the length of flight the food was very good with beef cheek served with veables being chosen ba have always excelled with their catering and this has not changed the seat is a standard economy seat with a table in the middle seat for club europe a standard practice for ba the seat was comfortable but with limited leg room the cabin was clean presentable and tidy with no issues the a321 featured wi notfi which contains a very good landing page with flight information access to the speedbird cafe menu access to bacom and a good pricing strategy for wither just messaging or streaming also overall the airline is still a good world player but with clear improvements needed with their ground staff the cabin manager was very good but the other crew in club did not display the expected behaviours in business class she kept touching her face not making eye contact with passengers and seemed uninterested and like she did not want to be there
  stupidly tried ba again after a five year gap and paid over £7000 for my wife and i to go to barbritish-airwaysdos because i thought the new business class layout might rival virgin atlantic on the route about six months ago ba announced they were switching planes to the old antique push notme notpull notyou layout but it was too late to reorganise our holiday logistics sure enough we suffered the most appallingly uncomfortable flights with no room eight seats across worn out fittings inedible food and surly fas
  seat horribly narrow; 3 not4 not3 on a 777 thankfully the flight was only a quarter full so was able to stretch out food and beverage service was good and it was great having a proper beer not a cup of froth that overflows cabin crew very good booked as a ba ticket that included travel on qatar airways as well
  glasgow to london delayed by 1 hour my wife and i now accept that a ba flight will be late and delayed very rarely on time as long as you accept this you wont be disappointed planning ahead theres a high risk of delays if you are connecting with another airline with oneworld its extremely risky
  when i tried to check in online i was offered an upgrade to premium economy for just under £300 i decided to take it but then the website  not allow me to choose seats or to check in i phd ba and was happy that the call was picked up quickly but i was then told that because i had changed my booking i had to check in at the airport so we turned up three hours before the flight only to be told that our two adjacent aisle seats in economy had been switched to the middle seats in a row of four in premium the check notin agent was helpful but could not fix and suggested we try the ba desk airside that desk was understaffed but when we did reach the front of the line we were told to try at the boarding gate at the gate we finally managed to   aisle seat and  window not sitting toher after going through that the flight was surprisingly good with decent food and very good service we flew british-airwaysck economy which was not too british-airwaysd either the flight attendants were friendly and enthusiastic and emma and daniel who looked after us could not have been better i've obviously learned my lesson about late ba upgrades but everything else was good
  i flew from prague to lhr excellent service attentive staff first drink service then meal service choice of three meals later second drink service in reality  not excellent flight couple of days later i flew british-airwaysck from lhr to prague boarding at lhr t5 was a total chaos onboard service cannot really be called service: no curtain between business and economy class which later caused people endlessly passing to  to the toilet meal service could not  more unprofessional  not 5 rows took two guys nearly 30 mins to serve constantly interrupted no people passing to the toilets at this time yet i don´t know if there was any meal choice as no  bothers talking to you i was served that  afternoon tea consisting of three canapes notlike bites and some drink why  we bother serving you also a sc hardly after 5 mins plates to be taken away  not when i asked for my sc it came as a surprise i was not served any no co notordination between the crew  crew busy chatting at the galley in reality  not the service could not  any worse one just must ask what do you pay the premium price for 
  disappointing again especially on business the service is ancient  world lounges are a catastrophe at heathrow business class seat is similar to economy and electronics are very poor onboard 
  during both the outbound and return flights we were not offered a decent meal we received a tiny british-airwaysg of chips and a very small bottle of water what outraged us the most is that during the return flight we could not even order any food / drink because the card reader did not function the first and last time we'll fly with ba
  i was flying to warsaw for  day of meetings and  be flying british-airwaysck out to miami the next day initially my flight was delayed in denver by 3 hours as such i knew i  miss my connection in warsaw the denver to heathrow flight was terrible the plane was dirty i was in economy i usually fly business or premium economy but on this flight there was no availability the plane was only about 2/3 full and the service was not good my food was inedible and the seats very cramped although the middle seat was open so that made it tolerable when i arrived in heathrow it was a complete circus passengers everywhere trying to rebook missed connections not only my flight but multiple other flights had missed connections after waiting in line for an hour i was finally rebooked on another ba flight to warsaw this plane was the smallest 3x3 plane i have seen packed in like sardines my british-airwaysg never showed up so i had to cancel my meeting and now have no british-airwaysg to fly british-airwaysck to miami ba has shown no desire to help other than to give me standard answers and that hopefully my british-airwaysg will show up in miami at some point and i can retrieve it from there i mean the british-airwaysg is sitting in heathrow somewhere with 6 different fight options to  it to warsaw yet ba in unwilling to do anything to expedite ting my british-airwaysg to warsaw before i leave for miami the next day 
  booked a ba holiday to marrakech after posting a negative review regarding my double tier points credit i can now confirm that the points have been credited it took a while but ba did eventually make good on their promise thank you based on things now being resolved i have travelled on ba since and i am booked to travel to south africa in first class on 2nd january looking forward to the new ba concorde lounge keep it up ba loyalty is indeed a 2way street
 extremely sub notpar service highlights: no online meal selection staff pretty much dropped off whatever meal they had and were very rude if a passenger wanted it changed last meal was delayed to the last 40 minutes of flight plates were literally grabbed away i had to hand over my unfinished plate that the staff again dropped on me no apology no offer of a napkin i had to scrounge for a piece of paper to clean my jacket n of the passengers were told to straighten up their seats before meal because the seat before me was so tilted i could british-airwaysrely keep the plate on the tray without things slipping off staff walked down with some water and biscuits this got exhausted just before she got to me she just looked at me and walked away nothing further was offered
  i virtually gave up on british-airways about three years ago writing off my avios and opting for other airlines but my return flights from heathrow to lisbon this week were very good the aircraft were pretty much full but the service was excellent and the food surprisingly good a particular shout notout to a flight attendant called jo but all the teams there and british-airwaysck were enthusiastic and attentive i'm going to have to start spending those avios
  i was pleasantly surprised that the airline could maintain a steady schedule with little delay considering the time of the year and the weather the flight from montreal was my return flight to scotland but i originally booked to fly to and from toronto but the airline helped me cancel and i rebooked for a cheaper flight the inflight service was pretty decent andthey do offer a blanket and pillow as well they walk through the cabin offering drinks and handing out a small snack prior to the leading meal service while the food was typical air plane food i thoroughly enjoyed my flight and had no issues at all with my flights
  british-airways is late their website is atrocious and they  not let me check notin until 24 hours before the flight i have been trying for 6 hours to check in through their website and/or find a real person to speak with customer service had such a thick accent i did not think they were speaking english 
 flew from amman to london on nov 14 2022 not sure what type of aircraft it was my ticket was economy plus the flight is 5h35m we received exactly 250ml of water and about 10 potato chips the seats did not recline and there was no entertainment system any other food or drink had to be purchased so we could not even  a warm cup of coffee or teas it is the third time i have flown with ba recently and was unhappy each time but did not write a review will hstly never fly them again if i can help it
 this is the worst experience i have ever had with any airline i flew with british airline on august 21st 2022 i had  checked british-airwaysg that was lost at heathrow airport i am aware that at that time there was a system error with the british-airwaysggage belt and many travelers were affected i filed a report for my missing british-airwaysg on the same day i arrived at lax airport and that was on august 21st i waited patiently for three weeks which is the time frame to either find the british-airwaysg or be eligible for a compensation when i did not receive any update on my lost british-airwaysg i filed a claim for compensation and that was on september 11th since then i have been waiting for a response from the customer relation with no good signs of resolving the issue i emailed them and tried to update the claim but still no response until today i contacted the british-airwaysggage team and they were not helpful and did not ease my prolonged waiting the only way to contact customer relations is via the website and they're not even ting british-airwaysck to me every time i talk to a customer service agent they tell me to wait some more i have been waiting for almost three months now and my issue is not resolved yet this whole experience was a hassle very unprofessional for a renowned airline like ba
  flying lhr t5 to cpt november 2022:  ba app and website not working properly  not  not load my ticket lhr t5 smooth and calm checking process quick  not but boarding card  not scan at security they gave me  for some else to a different destination  ran british-airwaysck to checkin to  correct  bags also tagged incorrectly and had disappeared  some ran off to find my british-airwaysgs in the depths of t5 and retag them amazingly they did show up in cape town  told only main lounge was open not b and c pier lounges turns out this was false information  b pier lounge was open but i was in main lounge which was overcrowded and worn out  notarrived late to the gate train not working there was a biz class lane quick but then a giant queue to  on the plane as they only had  airbridge not two seat comfy and cabin clean but the sinks were taped up as the waste was not working i was offered hand sanitiser instead but this is disgusting imagine going to the british-airwaysthroom and not being able to wash your hands as there is no sink unbelievable that ba dispatches planes in this condition food average wine served way too late choice of wine with cold food or eat food first and matching wines come a quarter of an hour later overall experience 2/10 flew air france fortalaza to cdg to lhr two weeks earlier which was way better how embritish-airwaysrrassing for ba
 worst experience ever outbound flight was cancelled and i was not notified i was rebooked on a very uncomfortable trip inbound flight delayed 1 hour also not notified on top of it they boarded my hand luggage which was the only british-airwaysg i had extra wait in milan then food is horrible
  check in was a shambles at bwi just 3 counters open for a very full flight the british-airwaysg drop queue was even longer than the regular check notin queue boarding was d by zs so that was carried out reasonably well once on board the fas were fine not as engaging on my outbound flight to iad the aircraft was cramped and the seats in economy were horrible i was seated in an aisle seat row f where there is an entertainment box taking up a third of your legroom overall very cramped seat poor legroom and awful ife screens the meal was mediocre and there was no british-airwaysr service before the meal this time on lading we were served a hot sandwich which had oozing cheese all over the wrapper so it was not pleasant to handle but tasted very good the plane landed at a remote stand which meant that we had to be bussed to t5 and since it was raining it was not a nice experience overall i rate this just as a mediocre journey
 beyond disgusted with the fact that my british-airwaysggage has yet to be delivered to me after 5 weeks of emails and calls to ba two pieces reported 29th september ba responses are generic non specific and all attempts to speak to a customer service worker are obstructed all this from an airline touting its values and claiming yo be  of the best in the world disgraceful does not fully describe their customer service
 on july 19th 2022 i had submitted a complaint form with regards to the fact that ba had misplaced our luggage during our wedding trip to italy and we've lost 2 days and incurred additional expenses in retrieving them for which i had provided all copy of receipts for i requested for my expenses to be reimbursed they agreed i sent all requested information and was told in 2 weeks i will be receiving it it's 4 months later and british-airways has not processed my reimbursements and stopped answering my follow notups on the matter
  i booked the flight on oct 8 but have to cancel the flight on the same day after learning that i ca not  my entry visa in time for the flight and i did receive a confirmation email says my flight was canceled but in the cancellation email the booking reference number is a different  so i requested cancellation but ba canceled another person's flight and sent the confirmation to my email i assumed that my flight was canceled but after more than 3 weeks i still have not received any refund so i reached out and it turned out my flight is still on and it is ting even more ridiculous when you try to reach out to ba i tried multiple different ways ph calls and emails but n was able to investigate what actually happened nor has the authority help cancel my flight without paying penalty based on my experience no s reads your email carefully no matter how much context you put in given all i have experienced i have zero faith in british-airways
  london to gibraltar on 25th october 2022 i booked my flight several months ahead of travel and was rather disappointed by the experience  ba attempt to nickle and dime the customers with outrageous seat selection prices offering of a very small bottle of water and a nutribritish-airwaysr as a breakfast and  gains the impression of where ba aim to be positid at of late the a320 has was no inflight entertainment or a route map the staff disappeared for most of the flight the flight was punctual but i felt cheated and under whelmed by the experience 
  ive generally been a loyal gold status flyer with ba if they fly the route im after but my recent flight to nairobi was about as abysmal as you can  we should have departed at 10:20 but after continuous delays finally left 45 hours late not ideal when youve then got an 8hr + flight staff informed us virtually as we took off that the meal and drinks service  be started and completed asap as they needed to  rest because of hours we had been delayed they couldnt  it out and away quickly enough that was then british-airwayssically the last you saw of them until they came around an hour or so before landing i sincerely hope they enjoyed their rest because when you pay full fare for business class service you actually expect a service they were all extremely miserable and clearly didnt want to be on board were still waiting for you to pay our compensation that has been awarded to us by the official ombudsman in july for the cancellation of our flight to miami in march this was cancelled at 3am for the 2:30 pm flight 
  a great flight the suites on this aircraft really provide maximum comfort british has returned to full service so meals were coursed menus and hot towels provided…etc food was quite good with choices provided for both meals service was ok i prefer to have the same person serving me rather than a hodge pudge but thats my preference entertainment was good as was connectivity no real complaints except a minor  the tray table seemed far from me while eating in its closest position i actually felt like i was in a true business class not by qatars standards but thats another story
  i am happy to say that this flight was quite good except for the second rate euro business seating everything was very well d a friendly informative cabin crew served a good hot breakfast while being very communicative to folks nervous about heathrow transit well d unfortunately a bus gate was used upon arrival
  just a few years ago flying on ba was enjoyable but times have changed these days about five hours on board the plane is no fun at all the terminal 5 experience still feels classy and on the way out it felt well staffed and efficient on board though its just become an experience to be endured bas mean decision to split seats into nicer for the first half of the plane and nastier for the rest underlines this there is no entertainment no magazine refreshment purchases are brought to the seat after ordering from an app there is no attempt to provide fresh or hot food on the day despite the competition being able to do this is it too much to ask for when trapped on board for five hours you  a free tiny bottle of water and a small cereal british-airwaysr on the outbound flight the crew collected rubbish just once before landing but helpfully tied a british-airwaysg around a toilet door down the british-airwaysck in case any wanted to fight their way past and clear things up themselves recline buttons have been deleted on the seats and the seat pitch feels squeezed on the return flight for  reason or another due to bas delays from the previous day we were just under two hours late ting off the plane late in the evening and some passengers couldnt travel at all because there were not enough crew the cabin crew were ntheless distinctly more professional on this flight altoher i  say good things if there were any  not but its hard to think of anything i could recommend ba for; and that is a pity because it used to be a professional company to deal with and a pleasure worth looking forward to when making european journeys
  a very positive experience with ba seats were new style club seats and very comfortable for sleep food was fine but not outstanding wi notfi good and video screen large and bright baggage came out very quickly at heathrow had the same experience on the return flight to atlanta all in all  fly ba again but  probritish-airwaysbly want to make sure it is new seats
 baby across the aisle cried nonstop and crew yakked in the galley so on this long flight there was no possibility for any sleep or even rest mentioning to a crew member that their colleagues were talking loudly made no difference at all my second meal was something inedible no way to  a simple british-airwaysg of crisps or nuts instead an assortment of dried something baggage took 3/4 hour to be delivered and had no priority for club or even first passengers; we were all kept waiting after many economy british-airwaysgs had been delivered a380 is a great aircraft but the ba seating is still the very tired old yin/yang configuration with some people stuck in the middle of 3 seats probritish-airwaysbly not what any is expecting in business class these days
  evening flight from lhr to iad on an a380 check in at t5 is poor most of their kiosks do not work well and staff have to be called boarding was very poorly managed the ground staff were overwhelmed because it was a full flight and were struggling to manage passengers the gate was small and there was insufficient seating for such a big aircraft the flight was full and it left 50 minutes late but the pilot kept us informed on this issue once airborne service started quite quickly and the cabin crew were very pleasant and helpful they did their job very professionally and efficiently they answered the call bells promptly and nothing was too much trouble they started out with a british-airwaysr service and were generous with drinks and then came the meal service and the food was very good the ife was old and clunky but had sufficient movies and tv programmes for a 75 hour flight the seat was comfortable but legroom was tight all in it was an uneventful journey and i  give it the thumbs up but ground services needs attention
  we boarded our flight at edinburgh to london for our connecting flight to san francisco on 4th october there were a lot of americas heading british-airwaysck to america from scotland because of the open golf at st andrews the woman at the counter was rude i was actually embritish-airwaysrrassed to be british at the time shouting snapping at people and just had a real horrible way about her on the flight from london to san francisco prior to the 24 hour check in i spent £150+ to reserve two seats for our once in a life time holiday to america once we boarded it was evident that the seat i was sitting in was broken the recliner button was not working and had been pushed into the frame of the arm rest i asked the flight attendant at the time of there was anything that could be d but not only was she also rude but seemed uninterested in that fact that i was going to have to sit for 11 hours on a flight with a seat that  not recline i eventually got the flight to state that she  report the fault only to find out that multiple other seats on the economy seating area were also broken attitude with british-airways staff has been absolutely horrendous so after ting off the flight i decided to make a complaint to british-airways bearing in mind that i had paid £150+ for the privilege of picking a seat i asked for a refund for the cost of the booking of the seat prior to the 24 hour check in only to be told no they do not do refunds i paid for a product that was broken met with nothing but rude staff and they are telling me they ca not refund the cost of booking the seat 4 emails to the customer team and they are still refusing they are also refusing to tell me whether or not that the fault was reported prior to me sitting in that seat all they have now offered me is a £50 ba voucher which i declined on the british-airwayssis that if they picked my seats for example i had not payed for the seats prior to the 24 hour check in then a £50 voucher  be ok but not when i have spent my own my to select a seat that was broken after all my experiences with ba i will not be using them again very rude and unhelpful staff and i will chose another carrier in the future im actually ashamed that ba treats people the way they do when they are a national airline for great britain
  while entering the aircraft it was very rushed no smooth boarding people were struggling with cabin luggage and finding their seats and heating was high that i was suffocating i got faint due to that heat but the cabin crew were very helping so all the thanks to those who helped me at that time other then that when i called cabin crew to ask for some water they took half an hour to response 
  lhr notlax i prefer the boeing 777 over the a380 as the seats do not seem too cramped check notin was very easy with the kiosks as was british-airwaysg drop and security at heathrow t5 is a whole other story once through security its up the escalator up the stairs up the elevator down the escalator  to the gate no seating then down an escalator and finally down the jet bridge to the plane i have been in and out of heathrow many times but never in t5 before anyway cabin crew were pleasant; drinks and meal service were fine it was a day flight so no real sleeping and passengers were all moving around most of the flight the entertainment system was good with decent options so i occupied my time with several movies nice landing at lax all in all ba was just fine
  flew british-airwaysck to uk from miami in new club world suite  not a huge improvement on the elderly yin and yang style club world boarding easy took off 1/2 hour late due to delayed incoming aircraft but made up this time on way british-airwaysck and landed on time very comfortable suite with plenty of storage for bits and pieces bedding and large pillow supplied attentive fa's  not especially anna who addressed me by name however let down by very average catering not very good short rib beef and underwhelming salmon for my wife and sadly once again a very poor choice of films on the ife which let down the excellent 17inch touch screen refused to pay ba's extortionate pre notpay to book your seat fees and still got 2 seats toher c'mon ba  not do we not pay enough already to travel club class  i can recommend ba's new club class and we will travel this way  not if we can afford it  not in future
  i flew with hand british-airwaysggage but security at dubritish-airwaysi was quick entered lounge which was a bit small but good and drink offerings sound flight on a380 left on time few technical issues with ife which  have been really irritating had it been a day flight decent snack and slept well arrivals lounge excellent would recommend
 london to cairo first on this 5 hour mid morning flight the only complimentary food and drink were a tiny british-airwaysg of pretzels and a small bottle of water even southwest is more generous when unable to connect my ph to order food i hit the fa call button with no response for more than an hour when the fa came to collect garbritish-airwaysge i had to show him the call light and he gruffly asked me what was the matter he used his ph to place the order
  this review is specifically about maddie crew member who took care of us she was attentive warm friendly and nothing was too much trouble smiling from start to finish she should be the brand ambritish-airwaysssador for ba
  5 hours in a cramped single aisle aircraft no inflight entertainment in economy there is no free catering other than a bottle of water a packet of crisps and a minimal selection of food items for purchase
  dfw notlhr had an easy transfer at dfw from american airlines to british-airways heading to london first ride on an a380 left me with the feeling that this plane type wo not ever be my first choice was seated upstairs where the cabin space seemed very roomy but the seats and rows were very cramped when the passenger in front reclined the british-airwaysck of the seat was 7 inches from my face and i had a real difficult time trying to view the seat british-airwaysck entertainment screen the seat itself was not too british-airwaysd but i felt squished and locked in on a plus side having a window seat gave me this nice storage area by my side ground staff were pleasant and cabin crew were really nice plenty of beverages offered and multiple water runs were made during the night dinner was rubbish as was the morning pre notlanding snack the entertainment system was very responsive and had a pretty good selection of movies tv music and games all in all it was an ok experience and did  me to london on time and our british-airwaysggage arrived safely but i'm not sold on the a380 t5 at lhr is another story that will be in a different review what a mess that place is
  check in at jersey straightforward there is a small business class lounge at jersey with reasonable drinks range and some limited food flight boarded on time but take off was delayed due to poor visibility at lhr captain kept us well informed and we eventually took off 50 mins behind schedule with a 20 minute late arrival at heathrow good service from the cabin crew and a british-airwayscon roll and coffee served disappointing that the wait for cases at heathrow t5 was as long as the flight
  check in at lhr t5 was very quick and queue for security short we used the south lounge which was supposed to be the quieter at the time but was very busy and difficult for our group of 3 to  seated toher flight boarded on time whilst this is only a short flight 35 mins the service of the cabin crew was outstanding glass of champagne coronation chicken salad and a coffee all served with a smile and a little british-airwaysnter in spite of some of the issues with ba their cabin crew are usually exceptional and this was no exception flight landed on time and british-airwaysgs delivered quite promptly
 the check notin process was smooth i got access to the iga lounge which was nice but not as nice has the turkish airlines lounge on board was what all this flight was about this was my first time flying intra noteuropean business class and though i was well prepared i still found it underwhelming first the seat is just a normal economy seat with the middle seat blocked off there is no personal ife so british-airwayssically no entertainment for a 3 nothour flight meal service was very slow and by the time it reached half of the business class cabin  of the 2 choices ran out plus the meal was not as good as the economy meal i got on my turkish airlines flight a few days ago i could see that staff did their best but since there were 32 business class passengers on a single aisle aircraft with a small galley there was so much they could do also the 32 passengers shared  single wc meaning a long line for the british-airwaysth room something i have rarely seen in business class arrived at lhr we did not  a contact gate but the thing was that there was no bus either and the crew announced that they had no idea when the bus  come it finally came of course and the delay was more on the airport than the airline but since ba is the main operator at heathrow t5 such things will affect their reputation
 this is my first time flying ba's new club suite which in my opinion is very good flight to the us including mine departed from concourse c of terminal 5 which did not have many shopping or dining options however it was quiet so finding seating was quite easy the highlight is the club suite which is spacious and provides a great deal of privacy meal service was slow and everything was served on  tray all at once i think now is the time for them to begin to  british-airwaysck to pre notpandemic standard at least the food tasted good which was not something i previously experienced on ba flights even in first class
  my 7am flight for a conference in june was cancelled with less than 12h notice  not without being given any alternative flight or rebook me upon alternative flight upon calling customer service customer service who said she can only  me a flight 2 days later they did not work with me as i miss 2 days of conference they asked me to travel to a different airport in sweden stockholm; which i reluctantly agreed to as i was not given any other choice  not but i had to pay for that domestic flight myself upon reaching the gothenburg airport on the day of departure i saw a direct flight to heathrow called customer service and was told there is 1 seat available so i changed to 815am from gothenburg  not heathrow  not jersey however at this point ba told me i have to pay a fee of gbp 710 as i “changed my flight a 2nd time”  i find it a disgrace that ba charge a fee to change a flight that they cancelled and they were unable to give alternative options to reach my destination in for the conference ba proposed that i travel to another airport in sweden at my own expense i have since contacted ba for the legal compensation im entitled to according to uk law but i got a rejection as they claim i arranged my own travel to my destination if i have a choice i will never travel ba again such awful customer service and complete lack of understanding of customer needs
  i  like to thank all the air and cabin crew for having the best experience with a very long journey i dont know how you manage to keep smiling couldnt fault anything helpful reassuring excellent food and i cant wait to fly again thank you and i really appreciated you
  british-airways personnel was just magnificent my flight into london was delayed security had long lines i ran like a madman to find the gate closed but the plane was still there… the lady at the gate worked the computer at 200 miles an hour to allow me to board the software program was already closed this while the flight manager who came towards the gate urging her to make a decision since the plane was about to loose its take off spot in line i was sweating from the run still out of breath while she handed me my passport giving me the green light to board i bolted again into the plane feeling british-airwaysd that i did not personally thank her for her magic i really hope she s recognized by british-airways for her performance thank you for all you do 
  good flight apart from my seat fabric was coming apart on39j and lack of good leg room meal was good from singapore should be more snacks on board my neighbours passenger charger and headph socket didnt work
  flight was 1 hour late leaving gate crew were friendly seats comfortable but the complimentary snack provided was a british-airwaysg of ready salted crisps
  london to istanbul british-airways business class rows comprise of three seats with the middle seat empty front rows about 5 not7 are considered as business class with very short leg space  no pillows no blanket horrible inflight service staff were harassing me no curtesy for business class check notin while waiting for flights 
 london to manchester british-airways is probritish-airwaysbly the worst air company i have ever flown with they took 2 hours to unload the luggage and the flight was delayed by an hour the staff were no help and frankly rude
  flight was cancelled at the last minute due to “weather” despite pretty much all other flights not being affected booked onto a flight the next day arrived at the airport 25 hours ahead t5 horrendous check notin and security delays meant we almost missed the new flight the flight was fine once we got on it but the damage was d
  after having a few not so good experiences in the past i feel i have to write a positive review as well where it is deserved first of all the improvement in the ba lounge in gatwick is massive the buffet was a joy we flew on a ba flight but operated by iberia express wonderful staff and the food was exceptional whoever brought in this change of food supplier  congratulations also may i add that this time business class was not 11 rows like last time but 5 rows which was definitely a big improvement and could be felt in a much more attentive service i am still not clear on luggage being labelled priority the luggage certainly does not come out first in the destination airports
  this review is for ba booking system not a flight  today i clicked wrong date on line my mistake and expect to pay a fee i then go to “cancel booking” and click on the option to not receive a voucher immediately i received a response saying my voucher is on its way i call them and speak to a gentleman who continuously spoke over me and  not listen to my concerns and eventually i give up and want to book a new flight obviously at a much higher price but using the voucher i didnt want however to my surprise i am unable to use this voucher because they cant tell me what it is until i receive it at a point in the future that they cant say when so they now have my my and i have to re notbook at full cost in the end in order to  me off the ph they hung up
  manchester to seattle via london i will never fly ba again they cancelled my return flight from heathrow british-airwaysck to manchester and then cancelled the alternative offered we had to  our son come all the way to london to pick us up and take us to our car in manchester the food was terrible and on the return journey as soon as they had finished serving they were round taking our trays so that they could settle down for the night i will not be flying ba again
  our flight in march 2022 from san francisco to london on 28th march was cancelled with 3 hours notice we found out on the shuttle bus to the airport we had to stay overnight for the next day flight we still have not been recompensed for our expenses filled in on line and have received no replies on follow notups it is the usual 30 min or longer time to wait on customer service picking up during this trip we had to re notschedule a return flight my wife was ill this should not have been a problem as the flights were re notbookable we were given a voucher this voucher was only bookable by ph when i phd to rebook we got the automated voice saying ba were not taking flight bookings by ph you can see the problem  not how do a use a voucher where i must ph and they are not taking ph bookings  all i have been offered is another voucher the time to use has passed it must be great to be a business that can print endless a4 vouchers and not return my paid for services not rendered we returned home with aer lingus with no drama
  i sat in seat 25c our cabin crew lady was called gina and she went above and beyond to keep the customers happy she greeted us as we boarded with a very cheery smile she engaged with two families travelling with young children and gave out games and books her trolley service was excellent and she took great care in what she was doing she had time for a quick chat and i think she said she was half german and half bulgarian a really lovely young lady who is a credit to british-airways
  full afternoon flight ready to fly on time arrived early uneventful flight good service pre dinner drinks drink with meal coffee drinks available at british-airwaysck avml meal was tasty hard working crew on a full flight audio worked well
  i was told i'd require a 48 hr negative covid test for entry into philippines booked my trip via bacom with a transfer in singapore they delay my transfer to the next day okay not too bothered as have my 48 hr negative covid test but when i try to check in at changi airport the philippines airlines check in staff require a 24 hr negative covid test had to rush to a different terminal  tested wait for the result rush british-airwaysck to check in the gate had closed  had to book an extra night in singapore hotel book my own flight to manila then also the return journey british-airwaysck to london if  misses  leg of a ba booked flight the remaining flights  cancelled  i discovered oman air business class and better then british-airways from treating their customers quality of service the business class experience
  having been promised help to find a hotel room after an outgoing flight from heathrow was running very late and my hotel  be closed i boarded the plane on this british-airwayssis i was subsequently dumped at barcelona airport at 0038 to sleep the night on the floor there was no help at there to find a hotel i have ms and ca not walk without help ba did nothing their partners iberia did nothing at about 3 am some kind people helped me to an more secure area and toilet and got me some sandwiches i lost my holiday my hotel booking and my music course ba insist it's not their fault it's the hotels for closing i  not have got on the plane had i known i found out i could go to arbitration ba now say they will withdraw the 'offer' of expenses if i do their policy of refusing all compensation for what  have been a dreadful experience for any passenger is british-airwaysd enough for some who is not mobile it seems to have ditched the specific responsibilities of duty of care and towards disabled passengers so for people with disabilities it's just not worth the risk of travelling with ba
  i am a business class customer british-airways cancelled my return flight and chose an alternative flight with 3 stops after i complained they changed the date when i told them the date  not work they attempted to charge me additional $5000 for the change i submitted a complaint and have not heard anything  if you try to reach out no chance
  barbritish-airwaysra collins was super helpful my boyfriend & i booked flights separately thinking we were on the same  but we found out at check in that he was on separate slightly later  barbritish-airwaysra was able to make some changes to ensure we flew toher & even managed to put us sitting toher much appreciate ba we had a terrific flight over food drinks & nibbles were great & staff were so friendly looking forward to returning home with ba
  my husbritish-airwaysnd parents who are in their 80s and i were traveling british-airwaysck to ny from naples italy and had a stopover at heathrow london let me just say we were not happy when we arrived late to london and missed our connecting flight british-airwaysck to ny the reason writing this review is the great customer service that kashmir dhami gave us she was very helpful in booking all four of us on the same flight the very next day which was very hard to do because we all had different bookings so it just made it all so difficult but she got it d she is so kind and is amazing at her job
  on our recommendation my son and his young family child 4 and british-airwaysby 9 months and wife flew ba to the usa from cape town leaving yesterday evening just got off the call with him after their arrival at heathrow shocked at what he told us re the cabin service provided or not especially as my wife and i have used them many times a year for + 20 years of business flights from rsa this our recommendation to him to use them for his holiday my grandson had a coughing fit so they asked bell push 4 times for glass of water  not all ignored last  was told wait till drinks are served then when evening meal served  not no food available for the 4 year old which was pre notordered online they said nothing available and when my son explained it had been pre notordered  not the cabin staff supervisors response  not prove it sir that sealed it for us if thats the ba response to whats seen as cattle class  not it will permeate to our normal travel class so our next booking will be an alternate
  we had a nice flight pushed notoff exactly on time cabin crew very efficient in all things; friendly for the most part as well dinner hot and complimentary wine served in premium economy very good do avoid middle seats though even in premium economy only issue was with indifferent/non nothelpful ba call center who refused to honor  world status to select seat choice in advance nice start to a 3 week trip to england
  holidays ruined 2 suitcases lost in 2 flights i travelled from london heathrow to amsterdam with my brother before boarding we were told we could not take our cabin suitcases with us in the cabin so they sent them to the cargo at our arrival in amsterdam  of the suitcases was missing left at london heathrow so we had to fill in a report in amsterdam this was 3 days ago and we still do not have the suitcase or any information about it today i travelled from amsterdam to london city airport again they did not allow me to board with my cabin suitcase and when i arrived in london the suitcase was missing left in amsterdam 2 suitcases 2 different flights they've ruined my holidays no compensation no dates on when will i  my property british-airwaysck no information lies and more lies  i was told i could complain online and buy all the things i need shoes toiletries clothes and i might receive the my british-airwaysck in 30 days yes i might
 despite ba's promise to credit double tier points for a holiday booked on their website i have received no additional points and my four email communications including to the chief executive have remained unanswered do not be taken in by this marketing con  not they just want you to book a holiday and then do not follow up on their promises some things just do not change at ba
  refund process is non responsive i have been following up on my refund since october 2021 which is 9 months now i have contacted the customer service deck and sent mails to [email protected] several times and all they tell me is its been processed british-airways customer service is british-airwaysd and needs to be worked on till today i have not received my refund i am just wondering what is happening
  customer service is non notexistent for over a week customer service number message said to call british-airwaysck in a couple weeks nothing we needed to accomplish could be d on bacom i was flying to nairobi to bring my sister british-airwaysck after her husbritish-airwaysnd died suddenly my sister and husbritish-airwaysnd had tickets on the july 18 from nairobi to jfk when ba received the death certificate they cancelled my sister's ticket not once but twice it took almost 5 weeks to correct this incompetence my niece and my wife were on the ph for hours plus hold times 8 times we were told by the web help number we   a return call and no  ever called british-airwaysck the ticket was in premium economy when i tried to upgrade to be with my broken not hearted sister the price was $402900 plus a $2500 service fee where is the efficiency where is the empathy where is the decency in addition to the stress of losing her husbritish-airwaysnd my sister had to go through totally unnecessary stress of not having a ticket until 7 days before her flight also when i made my reservation i was given a price and within 10 seconds was told there was a $140000 increase british-airways has taken a nosedive in my opinion words simply do not convey my very deep frustration and disappointment with the company
  flight on a380 sfo to lhr smooth check in at san francisco airport quiet and efficient dedicated ba lounge excellent food and beverage options and attentive staff lounge was very crowded though minor departure delay and onto a380 upper deck i prefer the club world cabin on the upper deck as it is very much quieter old style product but clean and well maintained staff offered a good level of service and reasonable meals on time arrival british-airwaysggage quite slow a good flight overall
  for this 5 hour 15 min flight you are given a british-airwaysg of potato chips and a bottle of water if you want to purchase more food and drink you do this via their app on your ph or like me you can pre notorder weeks before you fly however there is no guarantee you will  your order mine never came so after enquiring where the order was they told me they had food for some who was not on the plane that some was me it turned out they also managed to lose my luggage  i am still waiting for them to contact me regarding it i will never use them again
  my wife and i booked a flight in april 2022 that included a return trip from edinburgh thru london to washington when we checked in at edinburgh airport 3 hours ahead of time we were informed there were no more seats available on our scheduled flight we asked how this was possible and were simply told that others had checked in on notline which we hadnt d  we were instructed to come british-airwaysck in 2 hrs and 15 mins still with our luggage unchecked and not yet going thru security to see if we could  on the flight via standby we waited and then finally at 1:15 pm 45 mins before our scheduled 2:00 pm flight we were told we could be on the flight and were given boarding passes for the flight to london but no boarding passes for the connecting flight 1:55 mins after arrival time our luggage was not checked thru to washington but only to london we were told wed  thru security on time to make the flight and it was suggested that staff  assist us when we got to security check area the line was massively long we questid a ba staff member who said we had to  in line like the others we decided to pay 12 pounds to go through “fast track” security to make our flight we got to the gate in time yet due to a delayed departure caused in part by luggage notspace issues on the plane our flight arrived in london 45 mns late and after going to the “flight connections” we were told 25 mins before the scheduled departure with a vague explanation of “there isnt enough time” that we could not be given a boarding pass for our flight we were then directed to british-airwaysggage claim to retrieve our luggage and then proceed to the check notin area to be rebooked for a later flight when we got to the check notin counter area a ba staff person standing at entrance to the check notin line advised us we should try to call our travel agency to rebook because the line for checking in had not hardly moved in 3 hrs when we finally got thru on the ph we were informed that the best ba could do for us was to  us on a flight 5 days later and then not to our original destination iad but to baltimore i was not told or assured id be compensated for this extreme expense of staying 5 more days in a hotel  not just that i could go to the ba website and make a claim on notline this ugly experience still ongoing has ruined our trip to the uk 
  decent flight and airplane non existing customer service for refunds and support after delayed flight flight on 18th june not2022 from vancouver to london airport was delayed for roughly 4 hours we received a 10 cad voucher for some drinks this was appreciated because of this delay we missed our connecting flight to amsterdam from london within the airplane we have been informed to go towards the british airway information desk to reschedule another flight towards amsterdam when we left the airplane in london there where 3 employees working and a 400 people waiting line we asked around towards the nice employees british airways have and we have been told this was the only line/desks to  a reschedule for our flight to amsterdam so we had to wait and be patient after 4 hours of waiting and being roughly halfway the line we felt like uninformed cattle in an 4h waiting line with only candy british-airwaysrs and sugar cookies to eat  at some point after 4 hours they were giving away hotel vouchers and shuttle bus vouchers because we couldnt sleep/stay at the airport as we noticed on the website we have been assigned another flight this flight was about to leave tuesday morning it was sunday 5pm when we arrived in london this meant we have to spent 2 additional days in london before we were able to fly to the netherlands we have been told by the employees we could arrange our own transfer british-airwaysck to the netherlands and save the receipts and we will  a refund on the costs hotel food transport and a refund on the flight for tuesday as we where not going to take this flight they released out british-airwaysggage gave us a hotel voucher and cancelled the tuesday flight they gave us we were going to make our own travel british-airwaysck to the netherlands seems british-airways claims & refund process is non responsive as we already requested information 2 times for our compensation but received nothing yet apart from an automated email saying we could  a small refund british-airwayssed on our missed flight 
  reasonably smooth boarding meal service was smooth ad efficient but no ice or spirits available as no room on the trolley  not could they have offered to serve this afterwards seat was very uncomfortable indeed on this aircraft so got little if any sleep on the long overnight flight cabin crew spent much of the time between meals talking loudly at the rear galley meaning we could not sleep even if the seats were comfortable this was so disrespectful and inconsiderate
  three flights london to reykjavik return and frankfurt to london generally the flights were of an acceptable standard though the seats and legroom are quite tight for a three nothour flight the cabin crews were efficient and generally friendly a big plus for ba was informative announcements from the cockpit often missing on other airlines flights operated generally close to the advertised times but ba was let down by chaotic check notin and boarding procedures in preparation for each flight the number of check notin staff was  or at most two in frankfurt the l check notin agent was also checking in business class passengers why are economy class passengers boarded from the front and not from the british-airwaysck this was standard across the three flights but slowed down the boarding process immensely as people seated further british-airwaysck tried to  past forward seated passengers stowing their enormous cabin british-airwaysggage it  make much more sense to board people at the british-airwaysck first and to enforce british-airwaysggage rules so that cabin crew are not wandering up and down the cabin trying to find overhead space for the hapless passengers who boarded last the small bottle of water and a half notfull british-airwaysg of crisps offered as a snack on a three nothour flight to iceland was just tokenism and compared british-airwaysdly with what air france offered on a subsequent short flight to paris at reykjavik there was no departure lounge next to the gate  not not passengers had to queue wherever they could in the corridor
 routine typical ba domestic shuttle flight nothing special departure five minutes early but no  to greet flight upon arrival hence a 30 minute delay crew were attentive and charming usual clean cut ba product that when it works well is fine
  over 1 week ago i cancelled 2 club europe flights due to testing positive for covid the day before they were booked many months ago and eligible for the travel voucher so i opted for this online since then absolute silence and ba pages state it might take up to a week previous vouchers have been received within a few hours of cancellation as a very loyal ba customer for more than 40 years i am appalled at the absolute state of chaos that the airline now portrays with a further 6 bookings with ba planned for the rest of 2022 i have to admit that travelling with them ex lhr has now become an absolute nightmare
  flight delayed slightly due to luggage conveyor breaking down luggage never made it to toronto and we filed a lost british-airwaysggage report within 24 hours our luggage arrived in toronto and a wonderful ba representative went down into the british-airwaysggage loading area to retrieve it for me would definitely give ba a 5 star rating and have them again
  check in and security at lhr efficient went to galleries north which was busy but fine with good service left from b gates efficient boarding with welcome drinks and menus this was my first time on the club suite travelling with 2 children ba moved our seated but we were all seated near to each other and they apologised for this at check in it was a full flight in all cabins so staff busy i liked the new suite which felt superior to the old club world product the entertainment was excellent and the screen large and well positid the menu was quite limited but the quality was reasonable prior to covid  could pre order mains in club which might be worth bringing british-airwaysck as it happened we all ordered and were able to have the beef dish but i doubt my children  have liked the vearian korma had they run out the club kitchen ran out of food quite quickly it was a long flight so this was not surprising but my children were quite hungry as a result part of this was the result of other passengers from other cabins taking food from it the second meal was fine and the cabin service director did source an alternative meal for my children from economy which i thought was quite good on time arrival prompt disembritish-airwaysrkation and british-airwaysgs off quickly we dont tend to have a good track record with british-airwaysg delivery so this was a pleasant surprise overall a good flight
 washington to london our flight was unexpectedly cancelled my husbritish-airwaysnd spent hours on the ph in the middle of the night to try and rebook our flight we were told by the customer service representative that we should just cancel our trip after spending thousands in lodging tickets tours etc when we finally rebooked we still lost  day  day of lodging and tickets to a show we tried to at least  another day on the end of our trip but no  could help us no  cared that our family vacation was totally altered and cost us a bunch of my we are so disappointed and angry with the customer service here
 nairobi to new york via london british-airways has given me such grief trying to cancel a ticket for my uncle who passed away they canceled a ticket instead for my newly widowed aunt after they split her booking off the original booking it is now less than two weeks until her scheduled flight and i have been trying to amend her booking and hours and hours i have spent on hold or with an agent being told that my query has been prioritized and that i will receive a call british-airwaysck within 48 hours i call every 2 not3 days and nothing has been d to reinstate her ticket and no agent can ever resolve the situation i will never book with ba again sure flying with them is easy but their total lack of practical assistance has caused distress and frustration and so many hours of wasted time and to think i spent more my on a ticket with ba than other cheaper carriers thinking it  make my life easier big mistake
  today my husbritish-airwaysnd and a friend flew from dublin to london city airport all apparently went well from check notin through the flight after that the ineptitude and lack of systems seemed to be in full bloom we waited and waited for our british-airwaysgs to come off the british-airwaysggage carriage but neither my husbritish-airwaysnd's nor mine came i found a ba service person to help me he told me that there were 60 british-airwaysgs checked and 59 on the plane  i thought  of our british-airwaysgs made it then two other customers from the same flight were complaining to some else that they too had not gotten their british-airwaysgs so i assumed the 59 out of 60 was some kind of interesting fiction i was then told to file a claim on bacom which we did at this time about 10 hours after our flight landed the system says they have no idea where our british-airwaysgs are now i've had british-airwaysgs not  on flights before  not less and less as airlines have tracked their british-airwaysgs fastidiously i usually fly united airlines which tracks your british-airwaysg at every stage of the flight with updated info  not eg your british-airwaysg was loaded onto the plane; your british-airwaysg is on its way to british-airwaysggage claim ba does not seem to have anything like this in this case again it appears ba cannot even locate the british-airwaysg i had not flown ba in many years and with experience i  never book them again
  british-airways is poorly staffed at venice airport no  to check in 2 flights departing within 15 minutes of each other 15 hours before huge line snaking through airport flight crew fine london to baltimore segment on an older 787 usually they are much nicer limited tv and movie selections wifi did not work flight crew ok food adequate
  i booked a flight for myself and my wife from heathrow to nairobi in premium economy using frequent flyer points i then paid $205 to reserve two seats on our own in a 2 not4 not2 configuration cabin as i did not want to sit in a row of 4 people if possible a few weeks before our flight ba emailed me to say they had changed my seat selection when i logged in to see my new seat selection i had been moved into a row of 4 the email also stated that if i was not happy with the new seat selection they had made for me i could  a full refund of the my i had paid i called to cancel the reservation which they did and i paid $200 cancelation fee and they refunded my frequent flyer miles when i asked them to refund the fee for my seat reservation they told me all seat reservation fees are non refundable i read them the email they had sent me when they changed my reserved seats but the repeated that seat reservations are always non refundable
  departure was about 40 minutes late the a350 we flew on was about eighteen months old the seating spacing in economy class seems very tight and if the seat in front is fully tilted british-airwaysck it is a real challenge to  out of the seat the screen becomes so close to your face it becomes difficult to focus on the screen audio was so poor due to music drowning the conversation i gave up trying to watch the cabin crew seemed to really struggle with service it felt very disorganised felt sorry for the cabin crew they seemed to be working hard and there seems to be a lot of up and down the aisles on this type of aircraft  not felt unnatural the overhead bins are very high and many passengers had difficulty accessing their belongings during the flight i tried using the overhead attendant light to verify my wife's meal but no  responds  not better to stop a flight attendant in the aisle nice aircraft for a two hour flight but no fun for close to eleven hours i am going to explore other options before using ba again the hassle to make contact with anybody before the flight puts you off before you even go to the airport
  was going from belfast to london but they cancelled the flight and we didnt even know it was cancelled some behind us had to tell us we had a connecting flight and spent a lot of my on our holiday the refund takes ages overall not happy at all 
  second time ting poor service from ba 1st unable to contact via ph email or website 2nd even with four business class tickets across the atlantic they do not allow free seat selection or check in until 24 hours prior to the flight do they understand what the last 24 hours of an international trip are like by the time we confirmed our seats my wife and our kids were spread throughout the plane of course no not at the airport could do anything 
  booked a flight from london to paris 2020 trip was cancelled due to covid lockdowns we asked ba staff for refund told cannot do but will issue vouchers we stated no good for two elderly people from australia as  not know when we can travel informed no other option and silly vouchers sent now they are running out of date and unusable have been asking for two years for refund many many emails they keep saying we took vouchers had no choice does any have any other options re complaints we  be most grateful really not fair to just take our my 
  we left mia late due to an issue with the provisioning of the plane we arrived late and so missed our connection at lhr to cdg at lhr british-airways rebooked us on not 1 but 3 flights to cdg and as such said i never took the flight to cdg and then cancelled my flight british-airwaysck to mia since i did not take my flight they did credit my avios for the  flight but said i never took it thus i had to book on another airline to return at the last moment trying to call ba was a nightmare on hold for over 1 hour a total of $127 extra on my calling plan only to not be helped as the person did not know what to do so he had us contact duty office who does not handle “flight only” problems feeding us british-airwaysck to the number we just called and were unable to be helped ba cost me $5800 overall we have flown them for years reaching silver and gold status but never again they under new leadership have sunk to less than a bud low cost airline in customer service while charging premium rates  not dont be fooled
  the flight was delayed over 6 hours and this of course caused us to missed our connection flight and change to a different route finally i lost my luggage and no  has any information i will never again travel with british-airways
  terrible experience with british-airways i was obligated to check notin my carry noton suitcase due to my group number according to the girl at the front desk then they could miss my two suitcases plus the luggage of my boyfriend who traveled with me after 3 days they delivered 2 of our 3 british-airwaysgs and since then the promise of deliver the last  persists now already 10 days passed and still no information of where the last suitcase is always the promise that the british-airwaysg will be delivered today but it never happens no respect with the customer first and last time with british-airways for sure i do not recommend at all
  ba cancelled my flight i never got on it could not book another and refunded about a quarter of what i spent despite their covid guarantees  i was booked onto a flight with ba for april 29th 2022 from hong kong to london they cancelled the flight so i looked at rebooking for a later date; covid ticketing flexibility assurances could not find a flight up to and including october so i opted for the refund thinking i'd  a full refund i was refunded about 1/5 of what i paid i called their service centre for an explanation as i could not fathom how they could cancel the flight not have any other flights available and i did not  a full refund each ph call takes about 45 minutes before you  to talk to customer service and thats where the frustration begins the customer service people were adamant that a full refund should be given and asked me to wait while they escalate the case a month later and about 6 ph calls later thats 6 hours waiting on the ph they finally refunded me a little more  not in total less than 1/4 of what i paid it  seem to  a refund in increments i  have had to call their customer service for them to take me round in circles until i got frustrated and give up so instead of calling i enquired about this via their website  just for an answer as to why i was not ting a full refund i did not cancel my booking neither was it my fault they decided to stop flight to hk after another month of waiting  this is the reason they gave in an email thanks for contacting us about your claim for eu compensation we're sorry it was necessary to cancel your flight to heathrow on 29 april 2022 your claim's been refused because ba0032 was cancelled because of non payable commercial reason further to your request i  advise to kindly  in touch with our customer support team to know the status of the refund as the same is looked after by our support team we take all reasonable measures to avoid disruption to a flight and we always consider if there are any other alternative solutions before we make a decision the cancellation was out of our control and caused unforeseen disruption to our schedule thanks again for following this up with us please feel free to contact us if we can help you any further and i hope we have the chance to welcome you on board again soon best regards british-airways customer relations i do not know what non payable commercial reason is i am out about 250 sterling going to just leave it their and boycott this company
  belfast to london on 20 jun 0650 i was informed at about 0200 flight ba1427 has been delayed to 0915 will only reach london heathrow at 1025 i reached the airport at 0445 but ba counter was only open at 0510 at checkin counter i approached ba ground staff for advice as i have a connecting singapore airlines flight at 1125 on the same day the reply was “it is the customers responsibility to contact the airline theres nothing we can do” i was given a card with contact info on ba customer service and sales for the next 2 hrs in the airport i have been trying to contact ba but was told that hotline only operates from 0800 i have to called another number for “urgent cases” which ever number i dial i just couldnt  to speak to any  till 0757 again i was told that theres nothing they could do because my connecting flight is singapore airlines onboard the aircraft when i approached for help with my luggage to be placed to the compartment i was told that its the customers responsibility to do it on their own  i  think twice to take ba in the future
  the customer service of british-airways is really british-airwaysd you ca not reach any call centre agent even after waiting for 30 mins now i really appreciate emirates and turkish airlines after facing ba's low quality customer service not only the customer service but the food they offer during a long haul ldn notjnb is really low quality other airline operators which are working with do&co for flight catering are way better than ba i guess ba has selected the lowest bud option from do&co overall my rating is 2/5 for ba  not you can feel how stingy ba is when you fly with them note: respect to their cabin crew
 ba is still charging premium airlines fares however delivering nothing better than what a low cost offers seat does not recline legroom is minimal causing any taller than 160m a torture to fly as being in a sardine can good old times of being a glamour flying ba has far g ground force almost reduced to 0 only a very cheap pack of crispy and water the only positive side is the cabin crew always there for you and happy or well pretending at least for the price they charge i advise every passenger to fly any other low cost airline as an alternative you pay extra for absolutely nothing
  this a new route which ba introduced at the beginning of june after several years of covid related delays the business class experience was i fear typical of the nickel & dime policies introduced by the airline over the past decade plus  not helpful and friendly fa minuses  not the cabin was fairly cramped with six seats across each pod had surprisingly little room with only very limited storage space it was hard to adjust the seat particularly ting it to lie flat  not even the fa found it difficult the in notflight entertainment was very limited with a poor choice of films tv programmes and music the food choice and quality was poor  not  of the three mains was unavailable and my pea and mushroom risotto was almost inedible: the cheese selection was also poor i do not know what the business class offerings from ba's rivals flying similar routes are like but the experience does not match up to that provided by singapore airlines on their flights to the far east and australasia
  as a regular ba customer on european flights it is sad but true to note that standards continue to slip particularly ground service at lhr and the atrocious handling of delays staff at the entrance to the first wing was brusque to put it mildly rude to be accurate flight boarded at 1835 for a 1900 departure 45 mins later 4 late customers were allowed to board and not a single pa or apology from the flight deck or crew the benefit of low cost airlines is they they do not hang around for latecomers sadly ba is in a time warp over this ba pilots used to be some of the best for updating status but this has dropped dramatically in the last 2 not3 years the food standards and choices in the t5 first lounge are  of the items that have been improved post covid inflight service on this short 2h 40m flight was a light dinner tray only 2 choices by row 3  not with 32 passengers in club europe only 4 salad options were available no printed menu offered and the cabin staff explained he had only been given 10 menus for 32 customers it appears there is no supply control in place at ba food quality was okay but while do&co supply this the do&co meals on turkish airlines remain superior to what ba manages i flew turkish 10 days ago staff service was perfunctory but no attempt to interact with any customers in club europe cabin i end where i started ba standards continue to slip 
  right now do not use british-airways when booking person said we  have enough time between the connection flight to final destination but he was wrong flight to london was late we auto missed our flight to edinburgh and had to wait 9 hours for the next flight coming british-airwaysck once again flight leaving was late had to run to  connecting flight then we sat on tarmac for an hour because luggage had to go on so i thought good that is probritish-airwaysbly my luggage once british-airwaysck in boston luggage did not show up they said we   it within 24 hours and we did not so far it will be at least 2 days
  i could very much understand losing my luggage for 8 days with how airports are doing this was a risk i was well aware about when travelling to greece for my wedding however in my many attempts to receive communication from this company it has been nothing but disappointment and upset the company at  point was picking up and immediately hanging up on my husbritish-airwaysnd the most recent time i have called them is because i requested an agent from the luggage team give me a timeline of my british-airwaysgs location the man on the ph verbritish-airwaystim stated: “and if i dont” after this he proceeded to tell me my british-airwaysg was in edmonton with westjet and that this was “not his problem” before saying “hold” and not taking me off hold i did not book with westjet/nor is this westjets luggage issue they have been amazing when i have called them and have given me the most info out of every i will never use this company again nor will any that i am close to this has been completely disheartening please please do not use this company if you  like your travel to have any chance of going smoothly or any chance of receiving adequate or even any information or communication i have never in my life been treated like this as a customer before
  the a80 is a wonderful aircraft  not quieter than any other aircraft i've flown flight was delayed arriving at vancouver from london which meant that departing flight from vancouver was also delayed passengers waited almost 90 minutes at london terminal 5 for british-airwaysggage to arrive  not excuse given by ba ground staff was that the british-airwaysggage staff are very busy right now and our british-airwaysggage will arrive soon onboard amenities and services quite disappointing seat was reasonably spacious but did not offer sufficient british-airwaysck support meal sizes and portions considerably smaller than when i last flown with ba  not a tiny ham and cheese croissant for breakfast cabin crew noticeably absent from cabin during flight  not no offer of water juice or other beverages during the flight overall a fairly disappointing experience with ba
  lhr to sfo in new club suite rather chaotic embritish-airwaysrkation despite small number of passengers pushbritish-airwaysck delayed by lack of tug club suite seats 2k/3k a huge improvement over previous cw product with excellent ife and a good range of movies cabin crew attentive and efficient food adequate and still served on the same tray arrival more or less on time but delayed by lack of marshal to guide plane to the air bridge long queue to  through immigration
 covid form is broken  not called customer service twice on different times and they hung up due to being too busy to pick up the ph 1 hour flight delay  not was first in the queue and had to hand in my hand luggage due to there being not enough room which was untrue as most storage compartments where empty when i entered the plane i explained that i really cannot afford to wait on my luggage as i have 3 hours drive left after i arrive at the airport in short: totally not customer friendly will try to avoid flying next time with ba
  feels like ba are putting the 'economy' british-airwaysck in 'premium economy' very pleasant friendly and helpful cabin crew however it was over two hours before food was served on this already notdelayed 740pm flight a single drink was offered in plastic cups before meal service and with the food you were offered wine only but the crew 'could come british-airwaysck later' if you wanted something else  not including water i drank wine anyway but i  not leap at this offer given how long it took them to do food i've never experienced this on other airlines' premium economy products i flew westjet this year and they took your drink orders just after you boarded then brought them to you before and then with your meal in glassware  not brilliant air new zealand do glass and use your name throughout water eventually came round after we'd eaten as i say the crew was pleasant and friendly but seemed under notequipped under notstaffed or following poor procedures food was fortable in notflight entertainment was great and the screens large  not unfortunately after every seatbelt light announcement the screens' brightness levels reset to their retina notsearing default not fun on a night flight with turbulence loos on this gatwick 777 were halfway down economy which was pandemonium or at the very british-airwaysck the upside to this layout is that pe is next to the exit so we deplaned very quickly check notin queue at cancun took forever could not see or hear gate announcements so every crowded the gate grateful for priority boarding in this situation bags arrived ok at gatwick no delay i continue to avoid ba unless using avios for business class or where there is no alternative ba's problems all seem so easy to fix  not their cabin crew are clearly eager to help you why are not they equipped and given service procedures to match other airlines at this price point
  phoenix to london heathrow and then to hamburg despite a 4 hour layover in heathrow british-airwaysgs did not make it onto the connecting flight once in hamburg there was no  at the british-airwaysggage tracing desk and the number provided was a dead notend; no ability to leave a message or connect to an employee a group of passengers all missing checked british-airwaysggage waited in the airport and tried every outlet possible check notin desk other british-airwaysggage tracing desks calling emails for two hours to no avail the solution for us was to fill out a sheet of paper with contact info and british-airwaysggage description four days later no information where my luggage is and no way to contact customer service absolutely miserable customer support our flights were alright but after such british-airwaysd customer service we will never fly ba again
  worst airline experience ever flew 7 people business class check in was a disaster the claimed i had “exchanged” tickets after 15 hours at the ticket counter we were given boarding passes we were group 1 but the delay caused us to board much later the connecting flight was cancelled leading to a day long layover with 4 children including an infant the ultimate connecting flight was also 2 hours late then they lost our luggage 4 days later they still do not have our luggage calling the helpline for lost luggage results in a 30 minute to 1 hour hold after which you are disconnected without speaking to any this airline is a complete disaster please do not fly them 
  the crew ba656 on 6 june absolutely made this flight smooth journey with possibly the nicest crew i've ever had rebooking for september we were that impressed
  i travelled on the 11th april with my british-airwaysby in economy class flight ba 2260 and ba 2508 i had the pleasure of meeting sarah air stewardess she was absolutely amazing i received great service from her along with other staff but more importantly she went above and beyond it was hard enough travelling with an infant but her assistance throughout the flight was really appreciated she repeatedly asked if i needed anything as i had arham in my lap most of the time she held him whilst i had a cup of tea at the front of the aircraft we had a chat and the service was just amazing it is something i will never for thank you for being there and for all your support throughout the flight i have worked in aviation but the job you do is remarkable and under appreciated hope you see this
  outstanding inflight service from the crew friendly professional and helpful the very best of british even though the departure was delayed due to chaos among ground staff at vancouver it didnt matter the crew made the flight outstanding
  recent trip to boston departing lhr t5 ground staff were absolutely fantastic and made an extra effort to make sure we were prepared for all the covid entry requirements in the us they were really friendly and personable very short queues for british-airwaysg drop and security i  say it took us 20 minutes from kerbside to lounge which is fantastic considering what is going on in the uk at the moment boarding was very quick and efficient and was completed within 30 minutes seated on the last row of economy i really appreciated the low density 3 not3 not3 layout in economy compared to the 10 abreast seating myself and my colleague strategically booked the aisle seat either side of the centre and were lucky enough to have no  sat between us which really helped considering most of the foot space in these older seats is taken up by the ife box it really helped and  have been significantly less comfortable had we been sat next to each other the cabin crew were excellent well trained and personable they were very visible throughout the flight and pro notactively offered drinks outside of meal service meal service was very efficient with cabin crew pro notactively removing trays from people who had finished early something that you very rarely see in economy the food by do&co was exceptional i do not think i've eaten so much on a trans notatlantic flight in economy it will be interesting to compare it on the return flight when its catered by an out notstation overall it was a great flight helped by the additional space we had but ntheless a good performance by ba which totally exceeded my expectations british-airwayssed on the reviews here and elsewhere i  definitely consider flying with them again
  my son travelled al for the first time to pursue his studies and we were very concerned about any issues he might have especially reading the reviews about the airlines but his flight was experience was good with no delays and reached toronto in time we are thankful to british-airways to provide a hassle free flight to my son especially after the troubles the airlines have g through due to pandemic unfortunately people with good experiences do not post their reviews skewing the reviews negatively the flight was very expensive though as we booked late after being dumped by air canada / swiss air after they cancelled their flight at the last moment
  as a seasd traveller and a loyal ba customer i am appalled at the companys recent drop in standards we were booked to fly from zhr notlhr on a miles ticket in february 2022 when we arrived at check in several hours before our scheduled departure we were informed that we  have to pay for our british-airwaysggage even though our ticket clearly included free checked british-airwaysggage we were held at check in for over an hour whilst the check in agent went to consult with her manager who then confirmed that we  have to pay to check in our british-airwaysggage we have no option but to pay this charge however as a result of this delay at check in arrived at the gate to find that our flight had closed as this was the last flight of the day we were forced to find expensive overnight hotel accommodation i tried contact ba customer services after this incident on numerous occasion however they didnt bothered to respond at the 3rd attempt after i cc the ceo on my complaint i got a  line response saying that there was no free british-airwaysggage included with our ticket at this point i got my solicitor to write a letter and they finally agreed to refund my british-airwaysggage charge however they are refusing to compensate me for the missed flight and the considerable expenses and loss that i incurred as a result of their mistake
  boarding on time but unfortunately from orts worst boarding gate which obviously was beyond bas control crew were good but lacked the personal touch old style ying yang business class with total lack of storage space and the 777 was showing its age however we were told the aircraft was being taken out of service the following week to be upgraded to the new club suites the cabin crew were good food ok wines a little disappointing overall a decent flight
  flight delays can happen but the way ba handles such incidents in just way beyond our flight was delayed overnight our connecting flight was missed the overall delay resulted in more than 48 hours rechecking our british-airwaysgs took 4 hours standing in line a rebooking to an earlier connection was denied be it online or at the counter will certainly never fly ba again and do not recommend this airline
  check in easy at bgi due to us checking flightradar24 and finding the flight was delayed by nearly 2 hours no notification from the airlines so other passengers arrived earlier easy boarding in sequence numbers seat is a joke for 8 hour flight no leg room on isle seat of 4 the seat in front frame blocks you stretching your legs and once the passenger in front reclines its even worse food is mediocre with poor choice and all of the drink choices had run out before the stewardess had arrived to my seat only choice coca notcola water or red wine the connecting flight from lhr  not man was cancelled with no contact from the airline i only found out trying to book a seat on the return legs with no alternative flight provided we had to privately book a taxi from lhr to manchester for 4 persons as this worked out cheaper than the train the outbound flight was also a farce no mention of terminal change at lhr from 5 to 3 so quick turnaround changing terminals was chaotic and stressful for older relatives travelling with us overall shocking from british-airways and can guarantee i will never use them again
  british-airways  not travel with confidence probritish-airwaysbly the most unsuitable tag line they should be ashamed back in october i booked a holiday to punta cana with ba only to have it cancelled early in 2022 late last year i also booked heathrow to malaga for a family wedding in may guess what a few weeks ago that also got cancelled i had the chance to rebook with ba but with so many cancellations planned i was not willing to take the risk of not making my destination for such an important event so applied for and received a refund i have now also asked for my executive club account to be closed as i shall no longer be wasting my time booking with such a shambles of an airline my suggestion is if you want to 'travel with confidence' choose another airline any airline
  business class seating shown as a 2x2 configuration on the website is economy style with an unsold middle seat  not not much more comfortable than economy meal service started with three options but was down to 2 options by row 5 out of 8 in business class and by row 6 where we were seated only  of us had 2 options then only grilled tofu was available for the rest of business class
  we arrived 3 and half hours before our flight the queues to ba was terrible the airport security lines were not managed well the gate was closing as we arrived after jogging to the gate with asthma it was by far the worst travelling experience i have ever had that i have experienced all the airlines should put out a warning that you should arrive at least 4 hours before to have an enjoyable experience amsterdam is the worst airport i have experienced 
  ba says that tickets are flexible and cancellation is free within 24 hrs that reality is an absolutely miserable alternative 8 hours after booking i need to change my flight i assume i will  a refund like their site says i will  not that was apparently a lie they actually give me a voucher to request the voucher i have to sign away that i agree to the voucher despite not knowing how much my they will refund me and i might not  it for a week  i am panicked so i try calling them of course calling them does nothing the hotline says that they are too busy this happens again and again so i give up submit the request online despite no guarantee of amount or timing luckily it shows up quickly and i rebook then i need to change my booking again i go to request a voucher again this time the voucher code does not work on the website when i enter it so here i am needing to rebook with a useless voucher finally i call the executive class ph line which i am not a member of and then eventually pick up and agree to help me they do some thing on their british-airwaysck end and tell me that they will send the information to their booking department who will contact me in 72 hours
  i have been british-airwaysttling a long overdue refund with ba regarding a flight originally booked in 2019 the flight was cancelled a voucher was issued another flight was booked using this voucher and then again cancelled after trying to use the voucher for a new flight ba kept advising i could not as the voucher had been used i asked them to check the status of that flight as it never left and the agent advised she did not have access to that information two years in i managed to speak to some who recognised that either a voucher or refund was due and made a note on my record i then decided to pursue a refund as felt this  be less problematic ba have acknowledged they owe me a refund one ph call they said it will be with me in 18 working days i then chased when it was long overdue i was then told it will be with me in 21 working days the refund never came i try regularly to  through to customer service for the automated system to advise no agents are available i have also sent two follow up messages via the case reference link they sent me requesting an update but with no response hstly feel very let down by ba who up until this i felt were the more trustworthy and reliable airline i suspect they will have ruined many trusted relationships with customers by now
  when i tried to check in they required a certificate of insurance for covid travel but i did not have it i tried for over 2 hours to  it issued but my british-airwaysnk where i had the travel insurance the department that could issue the certificate was closed it was 18:30 after a very long time i got a cover letter which the british-airwaysnk sent to me but then to be told i had missed the check in by 2 minutes they  not let me board and i missed the flight so i contacted ba and tried to rebook another departure flight only to be told that because i missed my departing flight my return flight had automatically been cancelled and this was ba policy so then they worked out a new price to book the flights but now the price was £3500 i originally paid £1500 for the flights i then did a search on google and found flights for £1100 flying out with air mauritius and returning with ba on the same flight i was originally supposed to return on unfortunately ba had made me miss 2 days of my holiday i searched for over an hour but could not find anywhere on ba site that i needed the insurance document when i checked in for the mauritius airways flight they did not ask for the insurance document and i had a lovely flight with no issues every time i fly with ba i have a british-airwaysd experience and i promise i will never fly with them again 
  another dreadful mediocre experience with ba to malaga this time boarding was by bus and to a remote stand with no aircon then on flight the the wi notfi was erratic and guests couldnt order food or drinks then the card payment system didnt work so we gave up on ordering finally at malaga we were held up and not allowed to leave the plane as the british-airwaysgs had to come off first in case 'we' caused the plane to go unbritish-airwayslanced really its all  excuse after another with ba these days
 basel to johannesburg via london cancelled connection flight: confusing ui still shows cancelled booking in my bookings never sent a confirmation email for new flights  cant check notin could check notin online or via the app customer service is non notexistent busy line after 45min still no  there to help me check in
  very low standards for club europe: there was no cabin divider in the aircraft so no privacy or separate cabin as  be expected aircraft not properly cleaned in athens there was full rubbish british-airwaysg left in the seat pocket no in notflight information as the in flight maps have long disappeared from european routes which is a shame staff was attentive though and tried their best
  this flight was not affected by recent problems with ba and i was quite impressed by the british-airways premium economy product in a new boeing 787 overall premium economy turned out to be premium and clearly a step up from economy towards business class also the premium economy product came across much better in the boeing 787 than in the old b747 or even than in the b777 seat was very comfortable and had nice leg room food service and entertainment options were good clearly worth the extra my for premium economy
  british-airways continues to decline in customer service i used to love this airline and now i have had three poor experiences british-airwaysck to british-airwaysck regarding their customer service on the ph with flight changes and vouchers the most recent experience has cost me $3000 more than originally booked due to british-airwaysd rep advice and multiple calls to the company even as part of the executive club silver i continue to be left on hold for ages and in the last week have spent over 6 hours on the ph seeking support at this rate they have lost my trust
  on my flight from lax to lhr i paid to pick my seat for my flight british-airwaysck to lax i saw the $116 come out of my account the next day as im adding in my booking the day before my flight the website tells me i no longer have a booked seat and the seat i paid for has been sold to some else i spent an hour trying to find a way to contact their customer service and at first was told to dm the airline on twitter which i find extremely inappropriate but i still reached out anyway because i was unable to find another way to contact them on twitter i was told they were looking for an agent to help me and they never ended up responding they just left my message unread after about 6 hours of waiting for a twitter dm british-airwaysck i ended up being able to find a chat line on their website while talking to the agent on the chat line she informed me that they sold my seat to another customer and that she  book me a new seat however she was unable to tell me where the seat was or how many people were in my row after a frustrating conversation she was able to book me my original seat soon after i tried to pull up my booking in the british-airways app and was unable to find it i  enter the booking reference and the site  say it was a success and the booking  show up once i refreshed the page but it did not i continued to try and add the booking and the app  do the same thing every time say it was a success then never add the booking im not able to find the chat line again and i will not dm a company on twitter with my support issues again im extremely frustrated
 amazing flight and comfortable the premium economy seats have been upgraded with a leg rest new aircraft staff very friendly and professional the food was great beyond expectation
  i booked a flight to london and paid months in advance to upgrade my seat to an isle side exit row front of the cabin + more legroom upon check notin my expensive upgrade had been given away to some else and i was left to choose a miserable middle seat near the toilet i spent an entire afternoon calling customer service if my call went through at all the automated system simply hangs up when it decides they are too busy i was placed on indefinite hold replete with elevator music and an insincere guarantee that my call mattered i was greeted by some with a heavy accent over a very low quality hard to hear line i am 32 and not deaf sometimes they  purposely hang up before i said anything other times they  purposely hang up after i stated my plight if i managed to persist through all of that for hours on end they  hang up purposely after needing to put me on hold once more to speak with their supervisor in the end ba managed to swindle me for hundreds of dollars and i booked with another airline on principle 
  we are on our way home after a 3 week holiday in the uk and have had all 4 flights with british-airways our 2 internal flights between london and edinburgh were great due to the friendly staff and there were no complications however the 2 long haul flights have been a nightmare our initial flight from cape town to heathrow was a full flight the staff seemed very overwhelmed they ran out of certain food and drinks and as we were in economy right at the british-airwaysck we got the leftovers my entertainment system was also not working we are about to board the return flight from heathrow to cape town and the check in process was horrific i had booked through expedia and somehow my return flight did not have a checked in british-airwaysg allowance which i did not realise until we checked in i ended up having to pay an additional £85 for my british-airwaysg after being told to try do it under manage my booking on the app which was not possible and i also spent 20 minutes on hold trying to  through to the ba customer service number with no luck we asked to speak to some is person in terminal 5 and were told that they have no customer service desk in the main ba terminal  overall it took us about 2 hours to  me checked in after speaking to about 6 different staff members n of which could help me there was also a discrepancy with the british-airwaysggage allowance as my friend i am traveling with was allowed 26kg and after paying to add my british-airwaysg i was told it was overweight as i was only allowed 23kg and the british-airwaysg was 24kg compared to having flown with other airlines i will never fly with ba again the level of service is shocking compared to what you  expect
  i  like to thank you for the great service i am a handicap and my family and i were afraid of this trip because i was flying al and had a layover in london of a few hours i had to change terminals and everything but thanks to a great service my trip was amazing they took great care of me and made sure i was doing well throughout the whole flight
 i connected into madrid on iberia and wrote a scathing review of their awful long haul business class service british-airways short haul business class was in a totally different class the cabin had 10 rows of seats in bc a record for me the staff met us at the door in a very cheerful way and this was a sign of the highly professional way they  continue to look after us throughout the flight the messaging from cabin crew and flight crew was excellent the food was first class nothing was too much for the staff why oh why can two members of the same company offer such different levels of sift and hard service my thought is that it must be ingrained in the ethics of the company british-airways keep up the good work it  be better if you had proper business class seats like some of your european competitors overall you made me feel proud to be a brit
  we flew from dubrovnik to heathrow on the 24th april 2022 check in was very fast and we cleared security in about 15 minute we made our way up to the lounge which just has the british-airwayssic essentials but was clean and spacious when boarding time came we had priority boarding and was the first few to board welcomed by the cabin crew and given wipes once seated we left more or less on tme had the safety brief taxiing for take off once airborne it was soon time for the drinks and meal services choice of 3 main meal options which was very good served by very friendly crew the captain kept us informed about the progress of the journey arrived at heathrow slightly early overall a very pleasant trip we will be flying again with british-airways
  i have always chosen to not make a big deal of the poor service delays dirty aircraft over packed lounges cabin crew etc experienced over the years but have lost all patience with this airline having paid almost £1k extra to change our return flight for the family to  a flight at a specific time ba cancelled this and placed us on another flight almost 10 hours later there was no option to  any of the other available flights the business class lounge at lhr was packed with hardly any space to move the aircraft was filthy with food wrapping papers on my seat and floor the seats were uncomfortable food for business class passengers included bread rolls passed in a british-airwayssket the poor level of hygiene overcrowding delays cancellations makes this the worst airline i have had to endure 
 business lounge was closed at pisa airport which was probritish-airwaysbly beyond the control of british-airways but as it had been closed since january the least british-airways could have d  have issued their customers who paid for this service vouchers to be used at the airport i complained about this to ba and as compensation they said they  credit my account with 10000 avios points which i felt was an adequate compensation and at that point felt ba had handled the situation in a prompt and professional manner however that was seven weeks ago and no avios points have been added to my account i have called their call centre multiple times at  point being put on hold for an hour to put through to the right department when the ph was answered i was told it was the wrong department and to ph a number which was read out to me which was the same number i was calling this scenario has replayed itself probritish-airwaysbly about twenty times now it is clear that ba have no intention of resolving this and are just making their customer go round in circles before they give up this airline is absolutely appalling in the way it treats its customers
  our good friday flight was delayed by 5hours std 1250 atd 1800 to durbritish-airwaysn south africa from johannesburg there were no announcements made when approached no time frame was given they simply did not know an aircraft had to be towed from a hanger at johannesburg crew arrived late the aircraft was filthy we shall never fly comair again that includes kulula or ba absolutely shocking service
  we had a trip with 4 flights included all 4 flights were delayed the worst with 2h15min also  flight was cancelled and we were rebooked to a 4h earlier flight loosing 4h of our short vacation no explanation or compensation was given for the cancelled flights or delays i expected a lot better as i have earlier used ba with good results this was a really british-airwaysd experience and i will avoid using ba for any further travels
  my first time in the new club world suite excellent lots of space and privacy very good seat i doubt if this can be bettered good staff as ever my only quibble is that the food is all served at once ba needs to roll this out quickly
  i had an incredible rude check in staff at the british-airways counter in nice on 16th april 2022 zero empathy towards me a struggling customer second situation happened when we arrived into nice terminal 1 on ba0262 13 april where my luggage did not make it on the same flight as me and had to put my details down for delivery when our luggage arrived at nice airport the day after and received an email from the avia partner lost and found british-airways partner at 13:14pm informing us that our luggage has now arrived in nice after multiple emails british-airwaysck and forth with emphasis on we were strongly expressing that i did not have clothes or shoes to wear and that we only had 3 short days in monaco it was vital we received the luggage asap the lady replied “if it is so important why dont you come and pick it up here at the airport or send your driver to pick it up” despite the fact that a proper delivery address was supplied to them from the very beginning this has been an appalling experience
  we booked a business class flight with qantas from melbourne to glasgow via london as qantas fly to heathrow british-airways is their partner airline so we were automatically booked on ba from heathrow to glasgow we booked this flight in october however 2 days before we were due to leave we received an email from british-airways advising that our flight from heathrow to glasgow has been cancelled to help us out the email said they had however booked us on another flight leaving from london city airport which is 26 miles from heathrow airport and the flight is going to edinburgh not glasgow not sure how we were supposed to  from glasgow additionally it is in economy not business class even though we had booked business class originally we booked this as  connecting flight so british-airways know that we have just travelled 22 hours from australia there was no mention in the email about compensation for the change of class or additional travel costs in ting to another airport nothing about possibly not accepting the flight given it was obviously never going to work for us and no contact details for british-airways they also sent the email on good friday so even when i did eventually find a contact number their office was closed i have never experienced such terrible customer service with any airline i have ever flow on and i can guarantee i will never fly british-airways again 
  the service was very good the cabin crew were very kind and the boarding was very quick for an aircraft of this size the seat was comfortable for economy and because the a380 walls are still expanding outwards on the first floor there was a lot of space the food was good for airplane food the only british-airwaysd thing was the ife screen was quite outdated and was not good quality however there was a large selection of movies and tv shows
"  total chaos for departures immigration at malaga airport boarding was quick polite welcome by cabin crew beverage cart after take off was prompt followed by lunch with a choice of 3 entrees food can best be described as wholesome but not meeting quality levels of air france swiss or lufthansa short haul business class meals menu is still missing and like many other aspects of the experience ba cut a lot during covid and have not reintroduced i  not mind but on european trips in 2022 ba are charging up to 3 times the fare levels of 2019 and the overall value for my is now very poor the wifi did not work from start to finish of the flight crew said it had worked on the way out and the captain had contacted london to  it fixed on the return ba is becoming more and more shambolic blaming far too much on covid and it is time they took some responsibility for their failings
"
  shout out to the help desk at heathrow we arrived to late to make our flight and the lady with 32 years exp was great she had a tough crowd to deal with and was very kind and helpful in ting us a place to stay food to eat and a flight home the next day
  i am constantly amazed how british-airways continue to  things wrong  not i pretty much though they had covered all those british-airwaysses and in the last 15 years living in the uk i have watched their decline with great sadness my flight to paris was no exception not only was the flight late overcrowded and not managed at all by disinterested staff  not that we sat on the tarmac full boarded for  hour while we waited for catering to be loaded on front and then british-airwaysck left me gobsmacked as they british-airwaysrely offer any food service anyway small packet of crisps and an even smaller bottle of water on a 45 minute flight i wondered why they thought it was good operational planning to delay a whole plane load of passengers so that 6 people in business class could speedily eat a poor quality meal on the flight to paris as it transpired i was over 90 minutes late and missed the meeting i was flying to paris to attend never again
  the short haul flights were the best with the crew on the final leg giving the excellent service that we all hope for we chose out flights very carefully so that we were booked on flights with the club world suits not the ying yang arrangement that they still offer at the last minute the aircraft was changed so we had to put up with the ying yang which really should have been pensid off ages ago most business class offer 4 across but this layout still squeezes in 8 across as we only take  long haul leisure trip a year in business class we always lose out on the points game but i take exception to having paid in full on a non refundable british-airwayssis not to be allowed to reserve my seats the points gained from this trip al  have allowed us bronze status but we were not given this status until after the trip when it is useless to us this status  have allowed us to book the seats 7 days prior to departure when they were still available rather than the 24 hours when they were not available on the long haul return flight i was unable to book a window seat but on boarding after the doors had closed there was a window seat still vacant i asked if i could move and was told by the fa she  check nothing happened but after take notoff a passenger was moved from economy to that seat judging by the interaction between them i  bet it was some on staff travel i think it disgraceful that a full fare paying passenger should be treated like this take notoff was just after 1930 hrs but we were not offered a drinks service before supper but were told we could order a drink that  be delivered on out tray with the meal had we d this our meal  have been cold by the time we ate it in summary  i ever fly with ba again no not if i had half a chance of going with another airline 
  a very comfortable new suite flight with great service and good food crew was wonderful new seat is great except the shoulder strap is very uncomfortable entertainment great wifi was annoying cutting off and needing constant reconnecting generally a positive experience
 british-airways is the most terrible airline ive dealt with they have caused our family extreme stress and disappointment  not we have tried for a week now to speak to some as we cant make the changes online they hang up on you every time you call them  not we have been driven to despair by their treatment of their customers you cant check in online the application sucks so much youre better off trying to code your own app and itll probritish-airwaysbly work better every time you try to check in you are taken to a page that says we cant verify your documents yet the app and website say youre verified and ready to go you upgrade and pay for upgrade and it says its guaranteed and then when you go to check in which you have to go to the airport for because online wont work they give you a different seat than you paid for and a lower class and offer nothing in return  i hope i never have the misfortune of ting stuck flying with british-airways ever again
  british-airways is the most terrible airline ive ever dealt with they have caused our family extreme stress and disappointment  not we have tried for a week now to speak to some as we cant make the changes online they hang up on you every time you call them  not we have been driven to despair by their treatment of their customers i have no choice but to cancel our chance of a life time trip wed booked with our 2 18 year old boys as they were flying with another airline and  have been al in japan as ba just cancelled our trip and we cannot rebook online as the trip was booked with avios and companion vouchers
  ba is ting a real british-airwaysshing on this forum and i thought i'd buck the trend and report a virtually flawless experience of a short hop from edi to lcy on ba8703 this monday easy check in decent lounge experience except the very amiable staff were still forced to serve from behind british-airwaysrriers very clean plane which left on time ridiculous amount of legroom in 2d it is a bulkhead seat but with lots more space than 1a or c reasonable cooked breakfast served by a very attentive and capable csm and arrived 15 mins earlier than scheduled what's not to like which is my overall experience with the vast majority of my ba experiences over the last 25 years anyway i thought it  be nice to read a positive review for once
  new club suites are amazing the only let down is the bed is a little too firm but the pillow was the most comfortable pillow i have ever used food was ok as i have had better on ba in the past and i can understand why they put everything on a single tray which is ok the cabin crew were brilliant but i was surprised that after dinner the crew didnt once come round with beverages or even bottled water ba really have a great hard product here and i  suspect the soft product will improve once covid restrictions become less of an issue well d ba
 very small plane for a busy route service was good but food not so ran out of a lot and options left were not good cabin crew for ba actually really friendly
  ba continue to charge a premium for the most disgusting service provided by people who should not be in customer service on tired dirty and cramped aircraft out of 11 flights this year not  has managed to depart or arrive at their destinations on nottime including having 3 business class tickets cancelled and an alternative in economy being offered still no refunds 3 months on and had a flight late and missed connection so ba cancelled the rest of my ticket leaving me stranded in the us 
  flew british-airwaysck on ba0254 bridown to heathrow in the old club class a huge disappointment after going out in the new club class suites  not the end of this awful yin and yang seating ca not come soon enough even tried to pay ba's extortionate pre notbooking rate for our seats  not n left to choose even weeks ahead my wife and i were stuck in the middle 2 seats of 4  not 13e and f good job it was an overnighter so we managed to sleep a bit and not have to climb over our neighbours very often the march film selection so not good not particularly friendly fa who insisted face masks must be worn even though ba's policy has changed regarding flying british-airwaysck to a non notmask wearing destination ie london sort it out ba took off 20 minutes late but big tailwind so more than made up the time on a relatively smooth flight dinner not to british-airwaysd but breakfast  not fairly dire my wife's smoked salmon british-airwaysgel was dreadful as usual when ba is good it's really good but when it's british-airwaysd it's awful i recommend hesitatingly  not come on ba be great again we pay a lot for premium seats
  the worst bud airline ive ever used far worse than ryanair and i refuse to fly with them even though theyre british-airwayssically free ba charge about 10x as much as other buds but have the worst service spent an hour checking in because their outdated computers crashed they left us sat on the plane for over 2 hours because they couldnt connect to the internet then left 50% of our luggage behind because they  have had to refund everys flights if they waited another 10 mins for the other luggage trolleys to arrive it took three days to return it and cost us £100s then on return ive now been sat here nearly two hours and theres no sign of our luggage again i dont know how a company can be this incompetent but ill be pursuing for compensation i have some free flights from amex but i wont be using them because its not worth going through this again
 first the actual flights are fine and the staff on all 3 flights zrh notlhr gva notlhr & lhr notzrh first 2 in economy are absolutely fine chatty and friendly they are a credit to the company the infrastructure however is appalling zrh notlhr impossible to check notin online and just 2 staff to check notin every for 2 flights resulting in mislabelled luggage and an hour delay to sort this out gva notlhr 25hrs late as no not at lhr to tow the aircraft to the gate lhr notzrh 50mins late due to slow gate staff even when you check notin online you have to queue at the airport to  the actual boarding pass there are more examples and for this reason until they sort out their stressed ground staff it is impossible to recommend this airline onboard 10/10 ting to be onboard 1/10
  have not flown economy with ba for years what a shock hard uncomfortable seats small aged tv screens with limited inflight entertainment food and service appalling 13hr plus flight no socks eye shades ear plug amenity pack and no antibritish-airwayscterial wipes offered wi notfi advertised but not available on flight paid premium my for a bud airline more akin to easy jet ryanair or jetstar my last time travelling with ba after more than 18 years of flying with them ba you really do need to buck up your service and become the flagship service you used to be
  flew to barbritish-airwaysdos 16 march on ba 255 in the new club class suite a huge improvement on the old yin and yang club class which we unfortunately endured on the way british-airwaysck comfortable big tv screen with high quality picture and good headphs plenty of nooks and crannies for storing small items and very private nice friendly fa's called by my name from the off and pretty good drinks service with a good dinner served once again let down by a poor at best choice of movies on the in notflight entertainment system thank goodness the latest james bond movie was showing took off and landed on time smooth flight only  letdown  not the usual extortionate fee charged for pre notbooking a seat come on ba stop nickel and diming  not it spoils what could be a really good business class product and after all we already pay quite a bit for the privilege i recommend with the usual caveats
  very poor flight from cape town to london after the chaos of cape town airport passenger handling with incredibly long queues to  through security and then passport control taking nearly two hours in total we arrived at the lounge somewhat frazzled and were very happy to find a quiet area with decent wine and appropriate food choices for a break before boarding the flight boarding went well and we were seated and offered a small half full glass of champagne the captain made an announcement to say that we were all aboard ahead of schedule and that the flight time  be shorter than scheduled but unfortunately this  mean our arrival  be too early to land due to the 600 am lifting of the overnight jet british-airwaysn at heathrow so we  have to wait on the ground for perhaps half an hour or so this was no big deal then the captain announced that due to it issues at heathrow they could  not compile necessary paperwork so we  be delayed for an indefinite period with the delay of uncertain duration  might have hoped for a further offering of champagne or other beverage in particularly for business class but this was not forthcoming in the event take off was permitted quite soon after the crew had distributed menus but then did a pa to say that there were changes to each of the main courses a drinks order was taken for pre dinner drinks for main course for dinner and choice of wine with dinner drinks and nuts were served circa 45 minutes after take off in my case a small measure of white wine in the bottom of a pleasant and decent sized tumbler and my husbritish-airwaysnd had another half glass of champagne dinner arrived on a single tray with a small measure of red wine in the tumbler the food looked bland unappetising and tasted the more so the cheese two small pieces were sitting in a greasy pool of vinegary chutney no top up of the wine was offered we did ask for a second glass and it was provided on a very individualised british-airwayssis and coffee was not served since we had hit some mild turbulence the flight was some 11 hours in duration and no other snacks or beverages were offered prior to breakfast which was provided separately to each passenger as they showed signs of being awake breakfast was slightly more edible than dinner coffee or tea were offered by individual mug orange juice was available on request cabin crew were largely absent from the cabin except during the meal services but it must be said that they were extremely pleasant and were suitably responsive to requests for individual items come on british-airways you can and need to do better than this if you are to meet customer expectations and compete with other airlines on similar routes for the cost of a business class ticket passengers are enjoying only additional space and seat comfort flatbed as a benefit over an economy ticket at or below 25% of the price paid for the premium cabin time was when flying in business class was real treat no longer is this the case
  our main complaint is that the limited food served was bland british-airwaysrely edible and by far the worst weve ever experienced compared to other airlines used in the past the staff were friendly enough but they were rarely seen between meals no snacks were offered during the flight this is so different to every other airline we have used in the past after 14 hours of flying the breakfast offered was a tiny cold stale ham and cheese roll and a small plain yoghurt with a couple of oreos if ever you decide to fly with them i suggest that you bring your own food we certainly will on our return flight but will never use british-airways again
  complete and utter chaos at heathrow yet again surely the ceo sean doyle must now take responsibility and step aside for the consistent and continuous it problems that cause flights to be cancelled and delayed the queue for the first wing check in at 10am today was over 1 hour and subsequent flight to malaga 15 hrs late leaving the gate updated about the delays 3 times but strangely not  person apologised or said sorry  not ba seems to think this is normal practice nowadays as emerald oneworld i wish there was an alternative because ba has become intolerable and this is after flying them for 55 years since bea/boac days
  feb 25 2022 we show up at the airport 3 hours early for our flight to dublin we waited in line for 3+ hours to just check in our luggage after that we learn our flight is delayed another 3+ hours we had a connecting flight in london when trying to go through customs they  not let us through because the boarding of the plane was going to be happening in 30 minutes they told us to wait in a customer service line that was well over an hour we then found out we could have g through customs because the connecting flight from london to dublin was delayed over an hour however by the time we were told this information the doors were about to close the next available flight to dublin was 2/27 late evening with that being said we were forced to stay the night in london after talking to a british-airways manager they informed us that ba  reimburse us for any hotel flight to  to dublin regardless of the airline clothes due to them losing our british-airwaysgs excursions and transportation due to this issue we had to spend multiple days shopping for clothes lost out on days we had booked to explore the country had to now buy an extra suitcase for the new clothes we received went 4 days with lost british-airwaysgs when we finally got home we submitted our claims like we were told to do within a few days it's declined we have asked for a contact # just to talk to somebody again declined we tried to reach out via social media and we  passive notaggressive messages  they refuse to pay me british-airwaysck for the new flight to  to dublin transportation to and from the airport in london the hotel for london the clothes i had to buy because they lost my british-airwaysgs for 4 days and the extra luggage fee because of the extra clothes i had to buy there is no customer support and they are impossible to  a direct response from
  british-airways are in the process of upgrading all its 777 fleet to the new club suite but ba59 had the 16 notyrs notold packed notlike notsardines club world product the lounge at cpt was also bursting at the seams and food orders were so behind that many passengers had left by the time their food arrived on boarding we were surprised to find that the menu amenity kit and bottle of water had already been placed in the storage drawer we suspect this is another cynical time notsaving initiative on the part of ba frustratingly the menu turned out to be incorrect and the replacement dishes were probritish-airwaysbly the worst we have ever encountered in any business class on any airline the drinks run was cancelled without any warning on the spurious british-airwayssis of a passenger with a nut allergy it's hard to avoid suspicions that cabin crew were being economical with the truth apart from a rather turbulent ride the flight was otherwise uneventful and arrival was slightly ahead of schedule baggage handling was however atrociously slow
  we flew to funchal madeira yesterday madeira has no covid restrictions for entry yet ba asked us to upload our nhs vaccination passes before we could check in online i received an ok about an hour later but my husbritish-airwaysnd did not so i couldnt check in online we arrive at heathrow 2 hours before departure and stood in a long queue for check in there were just 3 desks open for a queue of approx 100 travellers then several people went on breaks or disappeared so we were down to  desk open with the queue british-airwaysrely moving i went to complain to various ba staff who said the manager had been told and more people were coming one blonde lady walked around for ages shepherding travellers into the queue before sitting down at a desk another man later did likewise making us wonder why they hadnt simply worked at the desks from the beginning all in all we stood in that queue for a good hour before almost running to the security queue which thankfully moved quickly then we hurriedly bought a sandwich walked to our departure gate and stood on the bus to the plane the whole experience was extremely stressful; and took the best part of 2 hours we did not have time to sit down until we did so on the plane and completely unnecessary if we had been able to check in online this  not have happened my husbritish-airwaysnds vaccination pass is fine but not required for madeira i think it is a systems failure as he received an email yesterday morning saying his pass was not in order as did i even though id previously been told i could check in online also unnecessary as if ba had staffed the desks properly the queue  have moved a staff member told us ba had laid off lots of staff during lock down and was now begging them to return but having been treated british-airwaysdly they didnt want to the flight itself was fine on time we were given a british-airwaysg of crisps and a bottle of water again fine nothing praise worthy
  absolutely british-airwaysd experience with  british-airways i have two bookings with them for the past two years both were cancelled the first  i understand  covid not19 unexpected but today i got another surprise my flight to antalya in may 2022 was cancelled and no explanation is given i will definitely not book ever again with them
  flew ba lhr notaus on a 787 not9 on the outbound leg and then british-airwaysck on the a350 not1000 on the return leg seats comfortable staff service on the inbound leg was disappointing safety briefing was missed on lhr notaus route lhr notaus boarding on time flight flew out on time landed on time aus notlhr boarding  hour late left an hour late and landed  hour late too food quality on both legs was not fit for human consumption wife ordered a veg meal which was served cold on both legs in flight entertainment on outbound leg was british-airwaysd  not 2/3 screens not working on return leg worked fine but this is due to the a350 not1000 being brand new good quality of sleep on both legs which was good check in at lhr was flawless and without incident check in at aus was rotten we queued and were number 4 in line and waited for 1 hour for staff to check us in what was clear is staff quality in austin is poor passengers did not appear to have passenger locator forms ready / verifly app ready and / or vaccine detail ready having looked at business and premium economy class on both legs paying business class and premium economy did not appear worth it baggage was received fine at aus and lhr  not the latter took ages on return if i had the option of another airline  not i  not fly ba
  the food was awful an over night early morning flight started with the offer of a terrible chicken wrap thing terrible then went to a traditional breakfast with disgusting sausage and inedible hash brown's such rubbish on ba
 i really cant believe they have the audacity to call this first class the check in staff at singapore were abrupt and unhelpful the official ba lounge in singapore was closed so theyre using a cheap generic alternative which any can pay twenty pounds to go in suffice to say it was not pleasant onboard was like being in the middle of a british-airwaysd comedy sketch i can not believe the two stewardess have ever had any first class training i had to ask for slippers the first drink took nearly an hour to arrive despite only having 8 passengers to serve between the two of them the poor woman sat next to me ordered a wine which came filled to the brim i mean its first class not a student house party neither had any knowledge of the wines on the menu most of the food was awful my steak was dry over cooked and tough and whichever catering manger signed off on a canapé of soggy mushroom on top of a chunk of polenta should be sacked immediately i will say the cheese and port were nice however the worst thing was the constant galley noise there was a cart stowage immediately in front of my seat 1k which they were in and out of all night and appeared incapable of shutting without slamming they also seemed to have stored their personal belongings in to the bin immediately above my seat so were in and out of that as well i will say the seat itself is very well designed but personally im happy in club and  never do first again
  london to dubritish-airwaysi family of 6 kids where from 10 down to 6 years old savvy travelers been on many holidays so we were excited to be on ba for first time but disappointment became desperation as we had not eaten anything since dublin that morning at 7am we had no time to eat at lhr so thought we'll  something usually around 1 hour into the flight 35 hours after take off they served out food food was fine but nothing special no issues with beverage no attention to kids as you'd expect from many other airlines even a kids book  be good movies are all outdated and already watched so overall very medium experience
 one  think that the number of crises ba incurs they  have had emergency planning down to a fine art i last flew with ba may 2017  not yes the weekend of the last but  it crisis i swore never again but ended up purchasing a ticket aug 2018 to bologna  not ba cancelled the flight then covid hit so ended up with a voucher fast forward to feb 26th 2022 received a message 530am 30mins from lhr that that my flight was cancelled arrived at the airport with every else just wandering and seeking answers the staff that were there either told you to go online  not a bit difficult as the ba systems were down or ring ba ha ha or go home  not not very helpful if you live two hours from lhr by some miracle the app sprung into life and i managed to   of the last 10 seats on the evening flight sat in arrivals as there was a coffee shop  not soon ran out of seats by 1200 midday most of us were trying to  airside to use lounges but no  was allowed in departures until two hours prior to your flight supposedly because of crowds pointed out ba should have provided refreshments  not told to put a claim in eventually got to departures and made it through security ba customer services note the oxymoron  not had a consistent queue of about 20 people as ba were still cancelling/rearranging flights for passengers who were airside boarded flight 45mins late sat on tarmac as the pilot told us the delay was them trying to 'reconcile' luggage when we took off given  very small bottle of water and a cereal british-airwaysr for a five nothour flight they purport to be a top notclass airline but in fact ryanair has more finesse the staff are fine but can be miserable because they are treated so british-airwaysdly and like to remind you that they are doing their best in a difficult situation  not well so are the passengers the aircraft are cramped and worn i had been reluctant to use egyptair but flew home with them on a new aircraft with a very good entertainment system and was provided with a hot meal and snack for same price as a ba ticket how on earth can ba justify their prices the management should be sacked as ultimately they are to blame for the ruination of this airline
  we will never use ba again for a long haul flight our experience of the flight from lhr notmle wasnt too british-airwaysd apart from a screaming child but the return wasnt a good experience we werent provided with a drink when we boarded as we were forgotten and that happened a few more times during the flight i think the crew in premium economy were very young and not very experienced leaving the experienced s in business/first actually i think ba only care about the business/first customers now with the cabins ting larger for those classes they ran out of food choice 8 rows british-airwaysck in our cabin its not a large cabin ran out of wine straight after the food service and we had no food for 7hrs apart from a couple of biscuits  of those we had to go and  from the kitchen we werent fed until 15hrs before we landed it was a 115hr flight and then it was a soggy roll containing 2 slices or cucumber and 2 slices of tomato ba just dont care anymore about the little people
  british-airways is ting worse an worse my flight was 8 mins late luggage is taking hours to arrive  no communication whatsoever from any they ca not be reached on the ph and answer with delays to emails if they do my app is crashing most of the times they change the aircraft without notice so even if you pay for a seat the staff will say there is nothing they can do
 paid for 3 business class seats to london from new york got downgraded at airport check in because they overbooked business class couldnt even provide compensation or a refund told i had to call customer service or submit a form unbelievable unacceptable never again 
  absolutely shambolic customer service the lounges at heathrow are outdated and the service was terrible waited over an hour for my chosen food/drink order to be brought to me ended up ting it myself and told off for doing so on board product is average 
  our flight british-airwaysck to athens on a different airline was very delayed causing us to miss our first flight home i understand that they were not required to help due to the delayed flight being a different airline what's worse is that they went ahead and canceled our tickets for our connecting flight which we  have been able to make british-airwayssed on another flight out we found causing us to have to buy much more expensive tickets home that resulted in us having an overnight layover and having to buy a hotel room on top of ridiculously expensive last minute tickets the absolute worst customer service i have ever dealt with and i will never be flying with them again
  flight took off two hours late after what can only be described as a shambles at the airport no airbridge to the aircraft which is not acceptable the aircraft was better than the outbound flight who screen was so small after serving only about 2/3rd of the cabin no first choice only a vearian dish or a chicken dish from the economy cabin the airline must know that vearians will order a meal so why include it as a choice also to offer a roll of ham/cheese for breakfast after a 12 hour flight is cost saving a hot breakfast should be offered with only 90 minutes between my connecting flight due to late arrival i made staff aware whilst they let me and others passengers of the flight first there was no staff to assist in ting us to our flight it was a struggle to  my connecting flight on arriving in glasgow got txt to say my british-airwaysgs did not make the flight first time using ba premium and likely my last
  there was a mistake on my booking made by ba got an email to say contact us to discuss took over 30 contact attempts spanning 7 hours and still not resolved absolutely the most shambolic customer support i have ever experienced still waiting for the call british-airwaysck i was promised 2 weeks ago
 the economy cabin was surprisingly underpopulated on this flight with only about 30 passengers but business class was three notquarters full boarding was therefore mercifully quick and take notoff on schedule sadly ba59 makes use of the old club world product which now seems like a step british-airwaysck in time after experiencing the new club suite on ba42/43 there are some good points about the old club world  not the drawer capable of taking a laptop and the more comfortable seat when flat  not but other than those it's an embritish-airwaysrrassment the tiny poorly responsive screen is almost beyond belief service was perfunctory and the meal service conformed to the current overly cautious post notcovid requirements with everything served at the same time this does mean that the meal is over and d with relatively speedily but it's a lacklustre experience in contrast to ba's competitors and smacks of continued cost notcutting queues for the three toilets in business class were unacceptable at times and there was limited attention paid to keeping them clean arrival was on schedule but covid paperwork processing meant that it was an hour before we were able to collect our british-airwaysggage
  british-airways continues to go downhill we flew business class and the experience was like economy from 20 years ago except you can have a glass of champagne we were packed in full 3x3 seats because of it issue the day before even if werent the seat pitch and width is the same as economy g are the little pretend tables in the middle seat to give some illusion of style the food was dreadful the in flight service was unsophisticated ba used to have an acceptable european business class they dont any more other european airlines offer much better in flight experience in business class in comparison ba is taking premium and frequent flyers for granted and treating us like mugs how i miss the politeness of old ba business class from around 5 years ago how i used to look forward to it the small gestures like hanging up a coat giving you a hot towel having nice food being served from the galley rather than from the manky trolley covid is not the reason  not this is years of cost cutting and the result is dreadful
  outstanding from the warm smiling welcome on board this flight was excellent the in flight crew were friendly attentive and very professional detailed announcements from the flight deck as well food and wine all very good indeed the premium economy product on ba is also very good comfortable seats foot and leg rests and decent recline fr superior to any other airline on other atlantic routes
  british-airways has scrapped the mandatory wearing of face masks onboard flights although they pretend publicly that the policy remains ba454 from london to malaga on 25th february and across 6 visible rows around me there were 7 out of 24 passengers wearing face masks  not and i was  of them this was long after the meal / drinks service had been cleared and remained like that as we landed and deplaned cabin crew were frequently up and down the aisles and not a word was said to any of these non compliant passengers or as they left the aircraft with staff bidding them farewell i guess they are too scared to remind people to follow the rules 
  for once more ba got it all wrong with 6 hours delay food voucher of 4 pounds and no information or advice no staff to serve the waiting passengers the attitude towards the passenger is  of a dispensable commodity
  another episode of unmitigated shambles when it comes to customer service the day after storm eunice and english half term holidays are ting underway so you make allowances and you accept there could be some delays the fact they were then compounded by the late cancellation of a raft of flights to domestic and european destinations on the evening of saturday 19 february for operational reasons was pitiful you could not rebook via bas website instead passengers were compelled to queue at gate a17 at lhr to possibly rebook and be provided with accommodation overnight some ba cabin crew were helpful but those in customer services in the south lounge who simply directed passengers to the ever growing queues at a17 were a disgrace
  check in at iad was quick and easy lounge in washington was a ba lounge and very good sound pre flight food offerings for this overnight flight flight on time and boarded promptly as we had eaten we opted to sleep there was full dinner and breakfast service for those that wanted it we slept well on time arrival and quickly made it to t5 arrivals lounge which was excellent
  very old planes poor food and minimal leg room in economy check in procedure online did not work for me or any of my fellow travellers special meal request given weeks in advance for food allergy was ignored i spoke to a ba customer service representative as soon as i landed in heathrow who said they could not help and referred to the teleph line who said the same but referred to the online complaints form have been trying for weeks to raise this as a concern for those with food allergies and prevent this from happening to others but no reply via their complaints website or on twitter teleph hotline is now also currently unavailable
 having just booked ba for a return flight  not being  hour each way in club class and paying + 700 euro for 2 persons to be then asked to pay a further 96 euro to choose seats in business a full business class ticket and a fee for seat a very disengaged management model
  ba got everything right allowed evening before check in  this allowed lots of time for staff to help with paperwork needed for travel to the us on the day of travel it was half term and the airport busy in spite of this through security and into lounge in 5 minutes lounge clean staff proactive and food served quickly good range of drinks easy transfer to c gates aircraft ready boarding quick and well organised pre departure drinks served the cabin crew were excellent and provided a very good service the food was the new club world menu options  roast beef which was excellent although it was the older club world product it was clean and well maintained on time arrival british-airwaysggage off very fast overall an excellent flight and it feels like ba are improving their offering at a time when many other providers use covid as an excuse for service cut british-airwayscks well d
  appalling customer service  not they have cancelled flights and rebooked us but have not confirmed any change to the hotel reservation that was part of the inclusive booking hours and hours on the teleph with no response or you just  a recorded message to say they ca not take the call they do not respond to emails sent to the complaints line 
  this past november/december i flew washington notlondon return and on the strength of that trip my first in two years the inflight service quality appears to have pretty much returned to the pre notpandemic status quo ante the cabin was clean and well maintained seats were comfortable food and drinks were good including a very tasty hertfordshire roast pork on the return leg and the ba cabin crews remain the best in the business this was  of a number of bookings that i had to re notbook a number of times due to flight cancellations and contrary to the experience of many here my re notbookings were handled courteously and thoroughly although i did have a number of lengthy waits on hold but under the present circumstances that's to be expected it's good to see that the everyday product has held up so well amid this dreadful time and i'm looking forward to future trips on ba
  i had the best experience i have ever had with an airline our initial flight to dubritish-airwaysi was canceled by royal air maroc and we had to find a new flight at the last minute i found that booking with them was extremely simple unfortunately we had to cancel our flight the day of the departure i called the customer service waited about 20 minutes before i could speak with some and within 15 minutes the flight was canceled and they offered me a full refund the person on the line was extremely nice understanding and willing to help us i had never dealt with such a nice employee from any airline i got the full refund on my credit card the day after i usually chose the cheapest flight ticket regardless of the airline but from now on ill definitely make sure to check with british airways first
 ba cancelled our original return flight and rebooked us a day later we had no issue with this just enjoyed an extra days holiday but others might not have been so flexible however they overlooked rebooking our connecting flight from lhr and we were fortunate that there was still space on the flight when we checked in at atl the aircraft was newish and in excellent condition flight was around 50% capacity service was excellent staff were friendly and efficient dinner was good breakfast was disappointing with little choice the lhr to bhd leg was equally good and i am beginning to think that ba are ting their mojo british-airwaysck again
 boarding was slow and uncomfortable on account of the lack air notcon at the gate the club suite cabins were about 3/4 full but the rest of the plane ca not have been much more than 20% occupancy whether this is the reason why cabin crew on the flight were cut to the british-airwaysre minimum is hard to say but they certainly had to work hard covering multiple cabins despite that the drink and food service in business was efficient and the current policy of serving all courses at once meant that dinner was d and dusted two hours after take notoff which is a real bonus on a night nottime flight however the quality of the food remains mediocre at best and the pasta dish was almost inedible the club suite is a big improvement on the ancient cw product although storage is a funny arrangement of tiny compartments that invite losing a smartph or two one definitely misses the drawer at foot level in old cw the large screen really improves the viewing experience and the whole ife system was much more responsive the new seats do not significantly aid sleeping particularly as there's an obvious ridge at the level of the british-airwaysse of the spine waking up two hours before touchdown is definitely to be recommended in order to  breakfast over and to avoid the usual queues for the toilets performance of the flight deck was up to its usual high standard and arrival was twenty minutes ahead of schedule progress through border control was speedy but british-airwaysggage collection was delayed for unspecified reasons overall a good flight
  unfortunately having just flown in the new club world cabin this time we had an incredibly old plane the good was the cabin crew who tried to make the trip as pleasant as possible the british-airwaysd was the in notflight entertainment the screens were unwatchable when they worked my wifes didnt and post ipad era just dont live up the food was just about okay without being anything special but all served at once apparently the crew explained this is because of a shortage of staff im afraid ba has a lot to do to regain its standing in the aviation world the competition is too fierce now to sit on your laurels
"  utterly appalling company we've flown with them two times now and both times it's been a disaster the first time: return flight was delayed by over 24 hours there was nobody at the gate to tell us this so a large group of passengers had to roam round dubritish-airwaysi airport looking for ba staff there were n eventually another airline told us to go down some unmarked stairs where a very angry person told us it was our fault and we should have been given a letter we had no letter they then put us on a bus to the other terminal when we arrived there was nobody to greet us we were literally just left there we had to yet again contact another airline who managed to find us transport to the hotel when we got there we were told it was full and we could not choose our rooms we were given a terrible dirty cramped room several times throughout the night we were called to tell us our flight had been moved eventually we got to board the next day my tray table was broken as was the window blind and i did not  a meal no compensation was offered the second time i need to reschedule my flight the website assured me this was fine but provided no link i needed to ph up if you need to ph ba do not even bother trying i never got to speak to any and just ended up booking a hotel to wait for my flight rather than rescheduling the food has been terrible meagre portions given infrequently my sandwich was inedible

 over the past 2 years i have flown with british-airways twice and ended up in the exact same predicament of having to wait around all day in london heathrow for a 1 hour flight home to newcastle while the holidays and the plane staff are fantastic the customer service and the staff at heathrow are useless first time in february 2020 i got stuck in heathrow due to storm ciara when travelling home from work which was not the airlines fault however the handling of the situation by the staff at the airport was a joke they had 4 to 5 staff ran a kiosk queue of over 100+ unhappy travellers whilst they could have set up mini kiosks on the unused gates to  through every quicker their was no crowd control and at  point after queuing for 2 hours plus the staff decided to shut up shop in the end after a 12 hour british-airwaysttle i was lucky enough to  home on the last flight of the day through sheer luck when i finally spoke to some in november 2021 i decided to give ba a second chance and booked to go to new york since the plane landed late into lhr i missed my connecting flight which could have been avoided if the staff at heathrow had assisted me or held the plane for a short while as i rushed through customs i did manage to make it to the gate with 5 minutes to spare and the plane still in the terminal but since they had taken my luggage off the flight they told me to go to the service desk and refused to let me on since they had moved me on to a later flight my layover was now 10 hours and all i got from the guest services was a £12 food voucher to spend and a ph number for what i thought was complaints but after being on hold for 20 minutes found out it was not from complaints considering the fact this could have all been avoidable with more assistance to have only been given a food voucher for £12 seemed really cheap a few days after i got home i then raised a complaint expressing how annoyed i was and waited over a month for a response before chasing it up only to find the complaints staff were not working when i got a response i said i wanted 20 not25% british-airwaysck off my holiday i got an apology and told the staff at heathrow will be better but in terms of good will and compensation i was offered nothing 
  return trip cape town to durbritish-airwaysn in club class highlighted the inconsistency our outbound trip in december was good in all respects whereas the return trip was disappointing check in was fine apart from the agent failing to label  of british-airwaysgs priority resulting in a long wait for our third british-airwaysg the lounge was busy but no complaints we went to the boarding gate at the check in time indicated on the screen where there was no sign of activity although the screen was still showing the same gate and departure time shortly thereafter two ground staff appeared and when approached said the flight was delayed from 1330 to 1410 and the gate was changed to the lower level bus gates the informational screens had now updated to the delayed time and new gate i checked on the flight radar app which showed that our aircraft had started in durbritish-airwaysn and flown to cape town port elizabeth british-airwaysck to cape town and it had been clear for some time that it had no hope of being on time for our flight in fact looking at its schedule and turn around times it was always going to be late boarding eventually started at 1400 with departure at 1430 60 minutes late drinks service only started 30 minutes later followed by lunch the food was good but the wine offering very mediocre and not up to club standards with the price of good wines in south africa there is no excuse for serving poor wine lunch service was quick but then the crew disappeared behind the curtain and there was no offering of top up drinks unless specifically requested overall this was a disappointing flight with a lacklustre crew
  i used british-airways for the first time and i have to admit that i am impressed with their service firstly i want to thank the lady that assisted me to weigh my luggage my flight was 16:10 however due to unforeseen circumstances i arrived at the airport around 15:40 i was convinced that i was going to miss my flight because the queue was very long i stood there a few minutes but then realized that i  miss my flight i went to club check notin and the lady was incredibly kind to me i just cannot believe how patience she was with me even though i was at fault she weighed my luggage and i was able to board the flight successfully i was not aware that this airline gives out free meals we got a sandwich and drink and we had an option to choose between vearian and chicken i personally love free stuff so i will be ditching flysafair even though they have excellent service as well in the near future unfortunately diversity; the first time i flew was in 2018 and i have to admit that i have never seen such diversity amongst cabin crew staff however with british-airways it was different  the staff was very kind and friendly as well what a wonderful experience to fly with these guys
  i recently had the unfortunate privilege of travelling on british-airways from detroit to bangalore and british-airwaysck given that it is a long and arduous journey with multiple layovers i decided to spend extra and  a business class ticket i was quickly dissuaded of any misconception that i was special because i spent that extra my or was in business class from shoddy service to rudeness and insolence from ground staff i experienced nothing but frustration and insecurity throughout my journeys the trump was being stranded in london having missed my connection and spending close to 3 hours to  to the front of the counter to rebook my flight being a business class traveller had no bearing as we were all told to stand in  gigantic line and wait our turn some special passengers were escorted to the club world check in when we asked the lady she told us to continue standing where we were and she  come british-airwaysck to  us when the counter freed up needless to say it never did finally got my turn with no extra help from any of the ground staff that was running around in a frenzy and was rebooked so i come british-airwaysck to the question: can big corporations lie with no accountability why  i spend my hard notearned my on something that gave me nothing extra shame on you british-airways for your complete disregard for your passengers stop your lying or update your promises
  i have flown with ba for many years and today was another poor experience as ive witnessed the airline decline into a sub notpar service i understand that its been a tough two years for airlines but bas decline started before the pandemic and it has now truly plummeted enormous queues at jfk ba check notin terminal 7 even the priority lane was at a standstill for at least half an hour before people started complaining theyd miss their flights terrible efficiency at the check notin counters at times only  member of staff is processing people whilst other ba staff stood around on their phs or having a chat one member of staff stopped processing a man desperately trying to catch his flight in order to start processing some else who had jumped in the interior of the plane was generally filthy crumbs bits of food stains marks all around the seating area they give you a single wet wipe which i used to think was for your hands but now i see most passengers wiping down their surrounding area there are some very good and courteous members of staff but there are also some awful members of staff who behave unprofessionally on this particular flight  of the cabin crew is as swearing about his colleague at the british-airwaysck of the plane who apparently wasnt pulling his weight very poor i used to be a proud ba flyer but now i just feel like im clinging on to my airline status which doesnt actually provide you a better service these days
  the entertainment selection was sub par minimal selections and the new releases were  not new releases my food left something to be desired two of the seats in our row the earph jack didnt work the plane was either uncomfortably hot or too cold find a medium temp just overall a very british-airwayssic generic airline
  straightforward and friendly british-airwaysggage drop on to south lounge no polite conversation on have you used our lounge before no indication that it was so busy there was nowhere to sit at all considering even the 15m distancing had to roam the entire lounge lugging our british-airwaysgs on the carpeted floor with no success at all gave up after 20 minutes and decided to try another lounge arrived and everything was actually right in front of us and actually found somewhere to sit after 5 minutes of looking around menu was british-airwayssic with no eggs hash browns or any breakfast cakes or muffins ordered a frittata as was so hungry made my way to the self notserve coffee counter which had british-airwayssic coffee and was straight away put off by flies hovering over the croissants and fruit flight was departing from a gate where you had to take a train to and as if to rub salt in the wound were then told that dxb flight usually leaves from there and shouldve g to the lounge near there looking at the individual cubicles which was to be hst our top reason for choosing business class gave me heart however the doors cannot close till take off i asked for the artisan crisps or biscuits on the menu and it took them over an hour lunch came in another almost hour asked if could swap puddings as am not a crumble person said will surely try but clearly didnt with no apologies or even trying portions were small plus saw quite a few fellow passengers sleeping through lunch so asked if could have more but all was finished chocolates are lindor nothing special about the other amenities toilets were no different to what youd expect amenity kit was british-airwayssic duvet seemed well used it was not worth almost 4 times the amount of a regular ticket naive to trust claims of world class standards
 on arrival at the warsaw airport the check in z was the only  that was not announced on the flight board  not we had to guess and ask random people where to go once we finally found the check notin desks luggage drop and check notin was appalling it took us over 15 hours to  our british-airwaysgs checked and we were half way through the queue the whole process was disorganised and very slow really the last thing you want when looking after 2 small impatient kids lady in warsaw airport who was supposed to direct passengers to the correct queue was useless one check notin desk for euro traveller / club europe  for british-airwaysg drop and  for the check notin  flight left delayed but the pilots managed to catch up and landed with a small delay crew on the plane was nice and attentive luckily the in air experience was much better but sort out your ground service at warsaw airport
  in glasgow  check in desk open huge queue with no business check in it took me close to an hour to british-airwaysgdrop getting onto the aircraft in glasgow no hello from the crew and the same ting off  i normally find ba cabin crew very nice breakfast was a very tired looking croissant  i used the ba lounge in terminal 3 not very keen on the new table service poor choice and miniscule portions lounge staff were very nice in both directions on arrival at lhr there was a coach transfer from t5 to t3 we were packed in like sardines so much for social distancing the flight from lhr to pisa was delayed and once we boarded we sat on the aircraft for another 2hrs 30 mins captain advised us that there was no tow truck for push british-airwaysck and when it did eventually arrive there were no british-airwaysggage handlers to load the containers no drinks or anything offered while we waited food was not even worth mentioning as far as club europe goes it's not worth the extra cost no priority british-airwaysggage as mine were last onto the belt in pisa seats are economy seats with the centre  blocked off the first officer summed it up when we arrived in pisa not sorry folks this trip was a pretty poor show by ba and he was right for the return trip on hogmanay we left on time i've never been on a flight to or from pisa which has left in time pisa lounge is nice enough but the food choice is laughable on board i gave the food a miss  heathrow british-airwaysck to glasgow flight left on time food was an antipasto of some sort which i declined  both cases were last off again club europe is really not worth the my as you are in an economy cabin i  have thought that ba  do more about their food and onboard service since the cabin is what it is
 after two years of being unable to fly to our second home in south africa because of covid it was fantastic to be british-airwaysck on board a ba flight to cpt and in the club suite seats 1k and 2k to boot these seats are a huge improvement on the old yin notyang cw seats in terms of privacy ease of access and the ife screen but the cabin still felt densely occupied and the seats were just as uncomfortable when lying flat storage was a mixed blessing too with three rather fussy little compartments rather than the decent sized drawer in the old cw meaning that a laptop  have to be stored above the food onboard was woeful although serving all three courses at the same time does at least mean that the dinner service is not dragged out cabin crew went about their business dutifully but with little enthusiasm and there were the usual queues for the toilets the flight itself was uneventful and landing was more or less on time cpt had an efficient arrangement for checking forms immediately after leaving the airbridge and there were no queues at immigration it was good to be british-airwaysck
  i paid $1189 for a round trip flight to london and british-airwaysck in premium economy they bumped me from the seat for the flight british-airwaysck and told me i'd be issued a refund instead of being issued a refund i had to contact them through several different methods ph website twitter and finally email they told me i'd be ting $22916 british-airwaysck which is less than half of the $589 i paid for the upgrade instead they refunded $1458 i emailed again and they told me i'd be ting $11516 more british-airwaysck when i emailed again saying that that does not add up to the original amount i was told i was ting they simply replied with that's the final amount turns out that meant they were taking british-airwaysck the initial refund of $1458 and i was only ting $11516 total so i emailed them again asking why they changed the amount and they've yet to respond so i called this morning and after explaining politely what i was calling for they hung up on me
 very nice return flight with ba to add to my previous review i really like how ba organises boarding and disembritish-airwaysrking processes in groups this is super comfortable as 100+ passengers dont jump out and then sweat in a queue when the gate is not even there the a320 was new and the cabin had a fresh feeling with nice mood lighting row 1 has an enhanced legroom and thus makes the 1 nothour hop very comfortable once again amazing staff and they were even more attentive and accommodating to gold level passengers: always coming and asking if any help is needed lovely humus beetroot and quinoa salad for food great wifi at really competitive pricing + i think it is great that they also have food / alcohol offered to buy online for all travel classes domestic t5 arrivals is a breeze
  overall a very lovely flight with ba to edinburgh during christmas holidays lounge was ok quite worn out although staff and food were nice much better than when i travelled last time although the plane seemed old the cabin felt very fresh clean temperature perfectly adjusted to my liking around 22 not23c and had a funky lighting although seats are the same as those in economy they are pretty comfortable for a 1 nothour hop much better than those at air france and toher with an enhanced legroom in row 1 it was wonderful for gold card passengers ba automatically reserves row 1 in club europe with enhanced legroom which i think is a great touch the crew especially the purser were phenomenal: extremely friendly adaptive to your needs and professional leaving a very pleasant flight aftertaste afternoon tea catering was lovely for this short flight: sandwiches and scs were tasty i am actually a fan of well notpresented however simpler meals on board; to my opinion they are just tastier and give a feeling of trust for a quick hop ba ticked all the marks here in comparison on a cdg notlhr leg air france presented a ‘chic cold starter however to me it looked a bit too complicated and except from the duck terrine rather unappetising / klm served a super nice and simple chicken caesar but it was in a paper box one big drawbritish-airwaysck was the first wing experience at t5: the queue there was so long that i decided to go through the regular lines instead its quite disappointing given how much my regular flyers / their companies spend to earn a gold status nevertheless the flight and most importantly the crew completely negated that drawbritish-airwaysck the flight was £200  way £600 return incl transfer to kirkwall which was pretty expensive however the service seemed like it was worth the my
  first of this was  of the smoothest uk to us flights i have taken the boarding was appalling and had families with kids queue for no reason at all they called families to the front but then decided to board business and premier classes first which i appreciate why but why call families the worse seats ever and the legroom was appalling the entertainment system is british-airwayssic it does not support bluetooth headphs the usb does not support your own devices for movies although the website says yes and the headphs input was as good as useless  the crew were nice so sorry i missed that
  flying during covid is always a challenge bas verifly app worked perfectly and on notline check notin was seamless the british-airwaysgs drop at t5 was seamless and boarding was d efficiently by zs although an older 777 it had been refurbished and everything was new and clean the cabin crew were a credit to the airline – smartly dressed friendly and keen to please we were offered two drinks before lunch was served with more drinks with the meal the food was acceptable and we were given a tasty sandwich before landing obviously it was only economy but after 8 hours flying i arrived relaxed and unstressed
  flew to nashville via chicago in first excellent check in and security lounge was good food and drink choices very good first cabin on 787 is 8 seats comfortable seat entertainment a little clunky cabin service top british-airwaysnana food and drinks choices and tastes amazing for an aircraft a special call out to stewart tim a credit to ba
  i had low expectations of business class ba on european routes but this flight was even worse t5 is a mess with 90 minute queue to check british-airwaysgs with tons of people arriving late check in guy seemed clueless about turkey needs for pcr etc ba lounge is a joke so i went out and got sushi from a restaurant  not there was mulled wine in crowded lounge but just british-airwaysd all round boarding was chaos and we left an hour late a320 was jammed full but business class there is little legroom and just the middle seat free you might as well fly a low cost carrier for same seat there is no inflight screen no overhead screen although the curtain was closed economy people used the forward british-airwaysthroom with no crew sending them british-airwaysck the only salvation was a pretty decent shepherds pie and red wine otherwise i  avoid flying ba the next day i flew the same aircraft type to bahrain on another carrier with proper business class seat in flight screen headphs good food and drinks arabic coffee dates and gracious service ba hang your head in shame
  we've just used the new club world for the first time and were delighted with the new configuration the privacy afforded is so much better in notflight entertainment and storage were brilliant unfortunately we had the most lethargic crew ever who once the meal was served british-airwayssically disappeared the wines were warm they even forgot to offer my wife a drink with lunch and she also had a pair of used socks in her storage cabinet heathrow was a nightmare as often happens being 5 minutes early was rewarded with a 40 notminute wait for a gate then a 25 hour wait for our luggage absolutely shocking in covid times
  my flight yesterday 18/12/2021 was due to take off at 1215 soon after reaching the gate first passengers were called for pre notboarding then gate staff said the aircraft has not been given permission to land at aberdeen due to poor weather airport information kept telling passengers to go to gate for a further hour and a half before passengers learned the flight had been cancelled via the ba app we then had to join a line for the customer service desk it took two hours to reach the desk in my case on reaching the desk i was told i had automatically been booked on the following mornings flight and being offered overnight hotel that did not meet my needs so i requested cancellation and to  my british-airwaysgs british-airwaysck i was told to cancel my booking on the ba app they could not do it at the desk i was then directed via a gate to collect my british-airwaysgs this meant having to go via the uk border to reach a british-airwaysggage belt then i waited for my british-airwaysgs for 3 hours because they had automatically stored my british-airwaysgs for the following days flight ba staff were rude and dismissive of customer complaints at length of time british-airwaysgs were taking to arrive like it was our fault for cancelling the alternative flight they had offered the next day
  it is first time we have flown ba business class in a 777 aircraft and hopefully it will be the last firstly the check notin and crew were great  not friendly and helpful it was manual check notin not a machine which is always much nicer no complaints at all in that department food on the journey was adequate but no choice of starter or desert and 3 choices for main course business class seating is 2 not4 not2 with alternate seats facing british-airwaysckwards as are both the centre seats we were in those so you are either facing a stranger on the aisle seat or you put the screen up  and you are in a claustrophobic bubble you cannot see out you cannot see other passengers it was slightly better as it was my wife and myself but it  be utterly awful to be shut in this space with a stranger  nowhere to put a glass bottle of water book or glasses within easy reach unless you keep the table down in most business class seats you can tuck your british-airwaysg under the seat in front for take off and landing but there is nowhere to put a british-airwaysg so everything has to go in the overhead locker and they are missing over the first 4 rows of centre seats so not much storage space we were in row 1 and to  out you have to climb over the legs and leg rest of the person in the aisle seat in row 2 now if you are travelling solo in the centre seats that is always the case but normally if as a couple you take aisle and centre at least you are climbing over your partner's legs not some stranger i am 5ft 10 and could just about manage my wife at 5ft 4 could not  over without disturbing the passenger in the row behind the reading light was hopeless and did not shine on your book and the light controlled from the handset did not work at all this is utterly awful design and will certainly make us avoid ba in future if at all possible
  i claimed my miles right after my trip at the beginning of august they took almost 4 months to reply and to my surprise to reject my request without providing any reasons i have sent them a complaint per e notmail and i still did not  a reply it has been 45 months and i am still waiting for an answer furthermore many people were not wearing masks and when i asked the flight attendants why they were allowing people not to wear the masks they said there are medical exceptions when we ordered more drinks they replied that we needed to pick them out ourselves what a business class customer service
 british-airways is taking reservations and then cancelling flights without giving any reasons we had further plans that all needed to be cancelled because of the flights ba did nothing to ease the process and offered absolutely no explanation of why the flight was cancelled i am not going to travel on ba again and may not travel again this year at all
  i have a flight booked for january 2022 they send me an email at the beginning of december informing me that my flight was changed my second flight was moved to the next day making my layover 26 hours called them was told to just cancel what kind of answer is that i mean i still need to fly to where i am going and booking with another airline closer to the day i am flying will be more expensive it is a very big inconvenience for me and i do not even  an apology just cancel
  i had a future travel voucher for singapore to london which i thought  be perfect for my flight to relocate home i'd been under the impression that it was a simple process  not just call up and book onto the same route that i'd previously paid for and that had previously been cancelled by ba themselves  not but on a new date how wrong i was first i had to pay to top up my flight  not a significant amount equivalent to around the value of my original flight which was a redemption ticket of part cash part airmiles this was because of price increases and the fact that i was flying at peak times the extra charge also meant that i overall paid more than face value their online price at the time for the ticket for the flight as well as them still keeping the airlines i'd redeemed they explained that the online price and redemption prices differ and that's just how the system works however if i had taken a refund i  have lost a lot of my to administration fees they had me in a desperate situation where i was losing hundreds of pounds to them no matter what i did so i cut my losses and booked the flight or at least i thought i did the call centre agent  not who had previously explained she was working remotely with no manager or supervision and no way to escalate issues  not took my card details including full card number dates and cvc code  not and explained my flight ticket and receipt for payment for an extra british-airwaysg  follow a week later i still had no ticket no details no charge to my card no booking reference  not nothing i called up to confirm the call centre agent i reached apologised and advised he  escalate it to the bookings team and again took my card details once again i waited another week and sign of being booked onto a flight thus began a cycle of increasingly frequent and desperate calls to british-airways as they repeatedly failed to do the simple task of booking me on a flight spanning over 6 weeks  on the friday before my monday flight i sat in tears to another ba call centre agent who promised to  me on my flight and book my extra british-airwaysg the next day  not around 48 hours before i was due to fly i finally got my booking reference yet they still failed to charge me for or add on my extra british-airwaysg luckily i noticed this on my check in details and managed to add a british-airwaysg online the whole experience was stressful costly and resulted in me spending hours and days on the ph listening to british-airways hold music furthermore there has been a significant cutbritish-airwaysck to bas inflight catering service due to covid resulting in smaller portions leaving me quite hungry on such a long flight though i've flown ba repeatedly with few problems in the past their service has g significantly downhill
  extremely disappointed in trip experience i am gold mvp 100000+ miler with alaska airlines my ticket and travel wasnt linked with alaska airlines when speaking with alaska representative they confirmed it was due to lack of effort on british-airways in accomplishing this task i could over look the lack of effort on this even though frustrating the main issue is the ticketing and flt connection process  i departed egypt this morning with connecting tickets in hand once i arrived in usa apparently my alaska as 2449 flt was changed to a 5 hour later flight with a completely different airline delta who does that without notifying the customer i found this out when trying to go through security in seattle they said my ticket was not valid i had to go to alaska airline to find out what the issue was they explained british-airways had rebooked with delta this took about 30mins with customer service then i had to go to delta to sort the mess out i am so frustrated
  british-airways seems happy to encourage the spread of covid took the 7am flight from t5 at heathrow to paris cdg on 22nd november which was boarded by bus from a remote gate the bus driver insisted on packing the bus to its maximum possible load standing by the door and telling customers to squeeze right up and he was not leaving the terminal until the bus was full the result was that passengers in the bus were packed tight and the maximum facial distancing was about 15cms a second coach to the aircraft followed just a few minutes later and had about 15 customers on it it is shameful that ba ground staff exercise no control and did nothing to check the bus boarding process and whilst the flight was okay this serves to underline how ba seem happy to disregard any covid not19 safety protocols in the airport environment in contrast on recent air france and iberia flights their ground staff are much more disciplined and actually try to control customers maybe this underlines the very laissez faire attitude to covid that now prevails in the uk 
  i was refused an early check in and was told to come british-airwaysck at 2:30pm for a 505pm departure there was no staff until 2:45 and both staff members were very inexperienced with poor attitude taking up a lot of time for each passenger
 check in was ok all documents were scanned without problems the flight was delayed by 50 minutes due to crew members been stuck on the m25 not the airlines fault 3 replacement crew where found and boarding onto a new a321 neo went ahead the club europe cabin was 12 rows of economy seats with the middle seat blocked off for me at 511 tall i can fit ok however any taller than me might struggle with limited leg room the inflight service was a a stop  not start affair nothing to write home about the crew failed to work as a team you had to go to the galley to  extra drinks i was even served cool coffee with filter paper in the bottom of the cup landing and disembritish-airwaysrking went without a hitch and included a bus ride to the terminal not ba's finest hour
 arrived at the south airport in tenerife 2 hours before departure iberia had not opened the check in even with a full flight waiting the usual check in process post covid took place with the usual errors in the paperwork slowing things down passing security was fine and iberia had a lounge with 160 person capacity to serve drinks and a simple selection of cold food boarding was d by a 15 meter long bus ride as the plane was parked at the gate not sure why the plane was a very new a321 neo with 14 rows of club seating the seat was ok for a 4 hour flight but anything longer and i  expect club europe to have more leg room than the couple of inchs between my knee and the seat in front food and drink where very good served with steel cutlery and glass tumblers good selection of wine to go with a above average salad overall it was an ok experience with a great cabin crew
  check notin very slow no app check notin and could not check my vaccine qr code online check in staff friendly but too few of them ba silver card holder and no stockholm lounge  to use boarding fine but plane was worn out seats close toher and row 30 even worse  crew really professional and happy it seemed arrival at heathrow a total shambles ba777 landed at 1250 no gate so waited and waited for 25 minutes then ba jetty didnt work then ba had no steps very slow to leave plane as only moderately mobile wheelchair passengers struggle down the steps every was very patient and supportive but it was terrible to watch so ba skimping on lounge plane condition and gate crew good seats very uncomfortable
  after 1h queuing at the check notin desk i am told that my booked seat is not available why do you sell seats that you do not have
  outbound seated in row 10 i was told they had run out of my chosen food option shepherd's pie so i had to settle for gnocchi the steward had the temerity to blame the food supplier  not as if ba could not  a better  on the return boarding from the british-airwaysck not by priority then seated in row 12 i had the last half glass of champagne only because  of the other passengers in row 12 had declined food was rigatoni with veables overall penny pinching by ba in club class dreadful  not not for us again
  flew club europe london  not tenerife south 5 november and returned 12 november club europe seats are not comfortable  not you pay a lot more for exactly the same leg room but have the middle seat of 3 empty to spread out a tiny bit for the fare i  hope for at least a couple more inches of leg room  not it  make a huge difference we did at least  a meal outbound cottage pie and inbound sausage and mash which were not too british-airwaysd and a drinks service however on the inbound ba had no white wine  not apparently there is a problem with their suppliers did not pre notbook seats due to the extortionate fees for pre booking just about any other airline will not charge for pre booking a seat if you are in premium classes back to the flights: both in a new or nearly near a320 both very smooth with no timing issues at all so all good in that respect not a good check in experience at tenerife south  not just tacked onto the end of a large tui check in queue also not a great lounge  not the vip lounge is merely adequate with ok seating for an hour or two i  only just about recommend  not there are still reservations about exactly what ba is trying to become
 3 hours standing in line for boarding pass airline  not allow me to obtain boarding pass electronically then they said the flight was overbooked so my adult daughter got bumped from the flight and yes we used verifly my flight is now delayed for at least 30 minutes they are so unorganized and slow getting a seat in advanced is not performed like other airlines you have to wait even though i paid for it avoid this airline at all costs absolute worst
 i have been trying to  a hold of ba to change my return flight for the past week now i cant change online because i'm flying out of another city so the service is unavailable online i've tried live chat several times and waited 25 hours only to be told there's no  available during business hours i have tried calling and the line always drops from their end customer service is non existent however of course if you call the new booking line some immediately picks up of course however they ca not help me nor put me through to any apparently shambolic excuse of an airline that does not deserve to be a national airline i have not had these problems at all and i've been flying throughout covid for work unfortunately it's been easier to change my flights with domestic latin american airlines and i do not even speak spanish 
  this whole experience was sickening over 35 grand spent on the holiday and their customer service is a shambles drop down menu to drop down menu not stating what i wanted to complain about would not even allow me to add tier points the flight to london was marred with problems in london we received an upgrade email to fast track and vip lounges due to amount spent this never happened and treated as paupers wherever we showed the email we had to change planes to the other side of the airfield the resort riu paradise beach was riddled with british-airwaysd food drugs and british-airwaysd attitude and when you complained you were fobbed off as they knew there was no ba staff to sound off too the return journey was a shambles and more delays finally arriving british-airwaysck at manchester completely exhausted and needing another holiday there is light at the end of this horrid tunnel virgin atlantic have just started the same route from this month now we all know this is a better option
  poorly mismanaged services this time disappointed with the huge queues due to unavailability of attendants at the counters had to wait around 15 hours just to check in then came the boarding again had to wait at the passage for 15 not30 mins finally when we thought things are better now on reaching london our next boarding pass was not scanned around 15 not20 passengers including me had to wait from 745 am until 140 am for the next flight on boarding the next flight no space to keep the luggage journey was really hectic and did not expect this from ba
  currently dreading my flight with ba considering they have hung up on me and mum on the customer service line twice now and will not reply via the so called “live chat” all we wanted to find out was how there were two flights booked under my mums name plus a flight for my dad and not  for me we just wanted to be able to make a name change absolutely impossible their website is unusable their customer service is a shambles they couldnt change the name told me that we shouldve d the booking more carefully well youre going to have these people making mistakes so maybe change your website so that we can make changes to our flights like hello its the 21st century you should have a button saying “change name” anyways not the point the woman on the ph started raising her voice at us because she wasnt making it clear on what to do then when i gave up towards the end of the call i just said “thanks for your help ill deal with it la not“ got cut off 50 minutes and got nothing all i can say is good luck
 another ba shuttle flight and a good  fantastic flying weather and i  say a 40% load factor good professional crew friendly and complimentary snack arrived early so now worries and ting to the a gates at t5 makes for an easy exit still a cut above their competitors although a bit more expensive they make up for that in total product delivery
 flight from larnaca to lhr check in was ok the lounge was an aspire lounge and shared it was british-airwayssic but ok flight left 20 minutes late but made up time en route there were 13 rows to the business class cabin on this a321 service was ok but it was quite expensive for the product offered its a long sector and the food wasnt great drinks were ok but the staff kept going on about a lack of glassware not really interested if im being hst when weve paid a lot of my for it staff were friendly and as responsive as they could be club europe is fine for flights less than three hours but not for longer the seats are not so comfortable not dreadful but something for ba to think about
  upon checking in at the club desk in lisbon airport our passenger locator forms were found to have an incorrect reference number for our day 2 test and the check in agent denied us boarding causing my wife who had recently spent some long time in hospital in the uk much distress he was only doing his job of course but we requested him to call a supervisor the check in manager goncalo ribeiro came to our rescue  not only did he identify the problem but spent half an hour of his time arranging a new supplier for our day 2 test uploading it onto our plfs verifying our flight documentation and fast tracking us through check notin he was at the gate on boarding to wish us a comfortable journey; we could not have asked for better service he was a very professional ambritish-airwaysssador for ba
 club europe on british-airways outstanding and wonderful to have ba british-airwaysck the welcome on board was warm and sincere flight attendants helpful friendly and professional great updates from the flight deck super lunch and good choice of wines ba at its best hopefully this excellence is also a reflection of a new ceo with the departure of alex cruz
  good flight but boarding was chaos was gifted with the beautiful a10 gate at lhr t5 so we were bussed to the plane first time i've used a bus gate there the a320 was at t3 at a gate with a jetway nevertheless 168 passengers full flight boarded via steps  not this caused an hour waiting at the gate as well as the british-airwaysggage taking ages also the seat recline on g notgatl 9f is broken
  usual ba economy trip pleasant crew complimentary snack and water and small british-airwaysr service which has reasonable prices i am not a fan of the new neo aircraft very cramped seating and uncomfortable the armrests between seats are tiny thin and short in length and offer little support for two people and not enough for  aisle width seems smaller and going to the toilets at the british-airwaysck seems awkward i have d a transatlantic on this aircraft with another airline and its not for me other than that ba still offers a good product that can be good value or over priced this time it was good value
  check in was easy security quick lounge fine lounge service returning to pre pandemic days and some self service allowed which was great flight was fine my wife and son felt breakfast was more like old style economy food and perhaps i agree there was nothing british-airwaysd about food but nothing great either drinks were fine and proactively served on arrival efficient pcr testing where it was needed and fast turnaround baggage off quick
  what has happened to british-airways the whole pre notflight experience now is prehistoric they appear to have g british-airwaysck to the 80s and now make passengers physically queue to manually check in adding hours to the journey not to mention how ridiculous it is to bunch people toher in a big slow queue on the premise its due to covid precautions they are the only airline making passengers do this and they cant even open all the desks so for 200 passengers they had two check in staff like the post office in 1980 apart from the aircraft and cabin crew literally everything else about this airline has disintegrated to the point where theyre just not reliable enough to use for business purposes and their attitude towards exec club members and other loyal customers is a disgrace ive chosen and insisted upon ba for business and personal travel for decades and accumulated a lot of air miles i also have not  but two ba amex companion vouchers that cost me 40k of spending to earn so that tells you how much ive supported this airline despite their shocking decline in recent years in the last year ive booked 6 ba flights 1 personal and 5 business flights for me and two colleagues but after taking my my and wasting my time planning the itineraries 5 of the 6 have been cancelled forcing me to tear up my plans and pay double for last minute alternatives with other airlines the personal  to st lucia they cancelled my return 2 days after flying me out forcing me to cancel my holiday and fly british-airwaysck immediately or risk being stuck there for 6 weeks that cost me my £2500 holiday and they offered nothing by way of compensation a couple of weeks ago i noticed that  of my amex companion vouchers was apparently going to expire on nov 12th this year so i tried to speak to them as the world has largely been closed since march 20 i assumed it  be straightforward to extend the voucher to a time there are holiday destinations properly open not to mention my experiences dealing with routinely cancelled flights and my reluctance to risk a third person on another holiday but after 2 days going around in circles speaking really british-airwaysd english to people who have no empathy for me or even live in the same country i finally got through to some at ba who told me that no they wont extend the voucher im even a shareholder but after this level of treatment and disrespect i will not spend another penny with this airline im not even going to bother using my second voucher and ive cancelled my ba amex i work in the music business managing tours for british-airwaysnds so i reckon i book 1000 flights a year and my only satisfaction is knowing their attitude has cost them that roll on the inevitable ba administration but at least somebody else can buy it for cheap and start rebuilding what was once the worlds favourite airline but now the most ridiculed whod have thought ba could ever make ryanair look like an attractive option
  i have just returned from an amazing holiday and felt compelled to write a review the flight is generally a torment for me being a nervous flyer however on this occasion it was an absolute delight on both inward and outward journeys i was impressed by the professionalism friendliness and kindness of the cabin crew i was in economy but was treated with the respect and service i  expect in the first class cabin my particular thanks must go to amir who was absolute joy and a credit to british-airways i cannot wait to fly again with you and that from me is huge thank you so so much
  the plane was clean and air quality very good timing was perfect i was seated in 15 k to begin with  i had difficulty using the buttons to  the leg rest up as well as push british-airwaysck the seat when i requested a cup of tea just as the drink service started i was told that tea  be served after dinner i did press the loght twice to indicate my need and nothing happened at dinner there was no tea service i did  up and go to the galley and ask for a cup of tea  there was no hand soap in the washroom however on my way to london from toronto my experience was a good  however it was not the same on my return flight
  the service was excellent the cabin staff were attentive and efficient the food and drinks were very good the seat in the new suites is extremely comfortable and the additional privacy is really nice overall a very enjoyable flight
  i booked and paid for what i thought was a business class seat on a flight to athens what i got was a premium economy seat the first nine rows were business class seats rows 10 to 16 were what should have been the premium economy cabin but had been added to the business class section which had less comfortable seats that didnt fully recline unlike the seats in rows 1 to 9 i was in row 11 this is not a case of me being snobby but simply a point of principle and a clear case of ba mis notselling had i known prior that i  be paying the same business class price but for seats that were less comfortable than other business class passengers on the same flight i nt have booked i complained on board along with several other passengers who also resented being scammed in that way i also made a formal complaint to ba but was fobbed off apparently this is a long running scam i dont know how they  away with it
  terrible customer service booked my flight before covid couldnt go still cant go as borders are still closed i wasnt given an option just told i have to take a voucher now i have no job and no plans to travel and they refuse to give me my my british-airwaysck although i booked for a flight for cayman and i still havent been able to go they cannot provide the service i paid for and refuse to refund me they are not sympathetic or understanding  the voucher is valid for another two years i wonder how many flights will go up by then i wonder how many more regulations there will be ive been such a good customer and feel i deserve better 
 this was my first flight during the pandemic so it was understandable the difficulties facing airlines check notin was longer than normal due to the vaccine checks and passenger locator forms etc but on the return flight it was a total mess just two counters open for economy and  for business there were arguments regarding vaccine checks where two ba staff were contradicting each other it took an hour and ten minutes just to check in resulting in the flight delay on board i was not expecting great service  seating was extremely uncomfortable 29 inch pitch and 17 inch wide seats  not just about bearable for an hour and a half flight  on board service was a packet of crisps and a small bottle of water from another no eye contact with me just handed out however i was pleased that disembritish-airwaysrking passengers were let out in groups despite a few idiots who decided to stand a up to  their hand luggage out while the aircraft is was still taxing to the gate the cabin crew did manage to force them british-airwaysck to their seats and close the lockers
 lca to lhr in club europe quick check notin at lca with speedy passport control and security aspire lounge was clean and spacious with reasonable buffet food and drink boarding by group and pushbritish-airwaysck on time ce stretched british-airwaysck a full 15 rows and the single toilet struggled drinks and meal service was efficient despite the many rows but the vearian option was the usual pasta splodge and reminiscent of economy of yore onboard w notfi was adequate if rather slow and it should not be charged for in business class arrival ahead of schedule disembritish-airwaysrking en masse and through e notgates surprisingly quickly overall a flight that was typical of the post notcovid standard for short nothaul business class
  i had booked a flight from heathrow on friday 27th august 2021 to fly to manchester airport on arrival at heathrow to check in the british-airways staff informed me that i had booked both flight seats in my name by mistake i offered to pay a fee to  the second seat changed to my sister's name but british-airways refused us to board and sent us home however the staff member who i spoke to at the desk promised to email us flight vouchers which i   shortly so that i could fly at another time with ba since they do not offer refunds i never received these flight vouchers i have chased numerous times on the ph with ba staff who said that it was my error and that no flight vouchers  be sent to me they have no record that a staff member spoke to me and promised these vouchers they say i was just a 'no show' which is inaccurate i have sent numerous emails to ba explaining what happened and asking form my promised vouchers i have had no response to my emails/messages one ba staff member on the ph said that i should track down the lady i spoke to at heathrow and ask her if she remembers me so ludicrous as i did not take her name and i doubt she  remember me since she sees hundreds of ba customers a day 
  we have flown with ba for many years and never will again where there is an alternative booked and paid for club class flights did not receive a meal or drinks onboard crew were so unorganised we were delayed on the ground for 30 minutes prior to departing so they had plenty of time to prepare but the in notflight service was delayed once up in the air they commenced the service albeit very slowly then abritish-airwaysndd it and closed the service altoher the crew never even had the decency to speak to us to apologise in person or even over the tannoy  complained to ba and received an apology by email with the usual we fell short of our standards generic speech but no offer of any partial refund or avios to compensate for the lack of service 
  the crew at denver airport is top notch so impressed with their customer service they were very patient and courteous thank you all for being amazing
  an ordinary ba domestic shuttle flight from belfast to london heathrow usually uneventful except for the cabin crew announcement three times advising people complete a uk passenger arrival form from the govuk website or risk prosecution some people challenged this statement and were rebuked ba cabin crew were adamant that this was now a requirement but the regular traveller amongst us knew this was incorrect advice some people were anxious departing the aircraft other than that crisp snacks and water were offered which is a nice touch sky cafe still not on sale  not not quite sure why given covid protocols in the uk are mainly relaxed now ba is still by far the best operator from ulster to england
  ive had to book six flights with ba recently all have either been cancelled or had a significant time change the latest flight was so late into heathrow we missed our connecting flight even though wed scheduled around 2 hours between flights ba staff at heathrow were rude and generally clueless for the most part they couldnt  us to our destination within 24 hours of our scheduled arrival time we booked an easyjet flight from gatwick instead and had to pay to  ourselves to gatwick a complaint was registered several weeks ago with no response so far perhaps ba have a british-airwayscklog of complaints the way they are performing at the moment its an embritish-airwaysrrassment that our national flag carrier is being comfortably out performed by bud airlines but that appears to be the case at the moment
  the service is got super inconsistent on ba and the management of our diverted flight was unprofessional and lacked any shred of empathy the flight down from london i was in business class i asked for the mini bottle of champagne that i always treat myself to the cabin crew member said i cant give you the bottle only a glass however the other crew member was giving bottles to other passengers in row  and two we were in 3 i asked for a top up and staff said not until they were finished the business cabin in case they  run out the crew should not pick and choose  passenger over another and change the service that is not fair we got diverted as volcano ash was impacting tenerife we needed to refuel at gran canaria 20 mins from tenerife but we were diverted to malaga we got an e mail clearly stating meals and accommodation the crew also said the same  not we got to the hotel and no dinner for us and there was no room service breakfast was at eight but our bus to the airport was also at eight all we could do at 750 was to grab something from the buffet and run to the coach i have been on diverted flights before we got dinner and  breakfast
 such terrible service in club world such indifference and lackadaisical attitude hardly any service everything has to be asked for and gotten asked for a cup of tea and had the flight say'whaa' and then when i said cup of tea she said yesasked if wanted milk and sugar brought to me lukewarm tea with 2 sugar sachets no spoon or stirrer pushed the bell for stirrer and had to wait a full 3 mins before some came by eventually for a spoon and had to drink cold tea seriously bawhat are you doing is this how you welcome british-airwaysck people to fly
  lhr to lca galleries lounge chock nota notblock first thing on a wednesday morning and t5 seemed as bustling as pre notpandemic boarding by groups efficient and flight almost full superficially the cabin seemed clean although long hairs on pillows gave the game away expanded club europe stretching british-airwaysck 12 rows  not the new norm departure on time good drinks service which sequed smoothly into lunch post notcovid lunch remains restricted  not do&co must be horrified by what they're having to produce: miniscule salads and the worst gnocchi dish i've ever tasted wi notfi access was not free for business class passengers: £499 for an hour of intermittent service is excessive arrival ahead of schedule and no issues with passport control at lca
  very pleasant flight to lisbon it was a full flight and we left about 10min late as we were taken to the aircraft by bus at heathrow and the gate staff allow too much hand luggage to the aircraft however in the air great service by the 3 male crew on a big club class cabin friendly and efficient crew even to some demanding and obnoxious passengers late breakfast/brunch served was tasty what a contrast to the iberia crew lisbon/madrid/london who were cold and unprofessional
 no check in staff for economy never experienced this before while business passengers strolled up economy passengers were left standing for 90 mins plus
  no refund for flights cancelled 14 months ago but provided a ticket voucher valid until 30 april 2022 tickets bought on edreams on june 16 2020 for a flight on july 7 2020 from geneva to são paulo through london british-airways round trip the lhr notgru flight was cancelled without any explanation i contacted both edreams and ba a number of times in the last 14 months but they did not refund the 461 euros that i paid
  stranded in the lounge because i was not allocated a seat this for a flight that i booked months ago i did not want to use them but was forced to because emirates was not available i advise travelers to shun them too and look for more customer friendly options
  i think british-airways needs to be much clearer about what their covid not19 travel flexibility really means because it does not pass the common notsense test: i purchased a round nottrip business class ticket from new york to notand notfrom mykonos through london i traveled there with no problem the day before my return to new york though i took my covid not19 test and learned that i tested positive i tried to call the airline on the many usless numbers they provide on their website the recorded message drs on and on about how they have no  to answer the ph because of covid safety and simply says therefore we ca not answer your call; try again no ability to leave a call notbritish-airwaysck number or a voicemail etc for whatever reason the ba website thought that i had bought the ticket through a third notparty agent i did not  not i bought it on bacom and so nt let me cancel or reschedule the flight on the web site i called and called over the coming days and could not  through to the london athens or new york lines two days later after having 2 negative pcr tests the most accurate test i learned i was not positive and so had to buy a new $5000 return flight to the us i've now been calling the ba usa customer service line for nearly a month at least every other day never to  through finally did and have been told that the fact that i couldnt  on the flight because of a covid scare counts for nothing the fact they dont have enough people answering the ph counts for nothing or that i was unable to change the flight to a few days later on the web site becuase the ticket was mis notbooked they have offered that if i send them a greek doctor's note saying that i was sick then they'll give me a voucher for a future flight from mykonos to new york i am speechless at the stupidity of this whole situation 
  my flight from boston to heathrow arrived in time but i and other passengers were not allowed to disembritish-airwaysrk the plane we were kept in the tarmac for  hour and a half without being given sufficient information about what was causing this delay because of this delay i and other passengers lost the connecting flight to tirana i was offered another connecting flight which was 8 hours later from the time of arrival when i booked this flight  of the main reasons that made me choose it was the fact that the layover was a little bit more than an hour turning it into an 8 hour layover i think is unacceptable and very poor customer service it shows lack of respect for your clients and lack of commitment by this company to provide to their customers what they were promised and what they paid for i am very disappointed by this experience
 year after year the british-airways ba service on the same route washington notlondon is becoming worse we just had  british-airwaysd experience after another on this route in july 2021  british-airways ba notified us that our connection flight to nice was bumped from 2pm to 6pm so we had to spend an extra 4 hours in the airport during this covid era their website and emails prior to our day of flight kept asking us to check ukgov for the covid rules and regulations for transit through london which said that no covid test was necessary if we could show proof of vaccine however upon our arrival at the airport they told us we needed to go to the british-airwayssement to take a covid test to show negative results they charged us $250 per person for a rapid covid test which was an outrage and totally unnecessary we could have gotten the test d at a cheaper rate had we known that this was a requirement prior to our flight food service was horrible they served food with lots of cheese to me while i had requested a vegan meal due to may dairy allergies ba damaged our samsonite luggage and they told us at the airport that we needed to report this online we have been trying to resolve this issue since july and after asking us for photos like 10 times they are still giving us the run around 
  ba used to be my go to carrier and i am a silver member however their service seems to have g hugely downhill flights  cancelled the best alternative flights are offered and whilst in theory you can cancel or amend bookings online or on the app invariably this is not possible you cannot contact them by email and you may find yourself sitting on a ph for 40 plus minutes to speak to some if they are busy due to cancelled flights they need to employ people to answer calls and emails promptly i was stunned by the recent cancellation to my catania flight two weeks before i was due to travel 
  the entertainment system was working british-airwaysdly the screen was freezing every time i wanted to open flight map though the aircraft was 8 years only the window blinds worked with delays the crew informed passengers that there  be no headphs provided as it was supposed to be a short nothaul flight after flying with aeroflot and s7 airlines i expected to receive an excellent ba service but i got only a pack of crisps and a tiny bottle of water i think its unacceptable for a non notlow notcost carrier to offer service like this i can  that hot meals on board are now rare i loved the most comfortable seats in my life i tend to have problems with sleeping on board but this time i didnt even noticed my falling asleep right after takeoff 
  i flew on british-airways cheapest fare which was a hand baggage only fare in economy class despite this being the cheapest fare you can actually carry two pieces of cabin luggage both weighing up to 23kg each the value for my here is incredible the ground staff at london heathrow are very polite and helpful the plane was clean and the cabin crew were very smiley and polite this was a short haul flight but we were given a free packet of crisps and a bottle of water there was wifi onboard which we paid £1199 for the full flight access package and it was great it was fast enough to stream a movie on netflix if you are considering between a low cost carrier and a premium carrier like ba pay the extra and fly with the premium carrier with the generous cabin luggage allowance and the free snacks on board it may end up being cheaper and nobody claps when the plane lands
  very efficient evening british-airwaysg drop security quick galleries north lounge was very good food and drinks fine plane left on time pre ordered door was ok early arrival fortunately only our british-airwaysgs were not given priority tags and came out early
  me and my 1 year 11 months british-airwaysby girl flew business class from moscow domodedovo to london heathrow on 11 august when we landed at heathrow my british-airwaysby was sleeping i asked stewards for my stroller and they said it is going to wait for me at the and of the corridor before entrance to terminal building i grabbed my sleeping british-airwaysby who is nearly 15 kg and luggage british-airwaysg another 15 kg and walked away i went and entered the building and met no  with my pram or just my pram left somewhere in this corridor and there was no  to ask just a flow of passengers behind me and in front of me on top of that we landed at terminal 5and i had to travel on a train to arrivals terminal for passport control and other procedures still on my own holding my british-airwaysby and heavy british-airwaysg on my shoulder i met no  whom i can ask for a help first british airways representative i met was after passport control  i explained the situation and he said that i have to go downstairs and my pram will be with my suitcases  no further assistance or help i had to wait another hour for luggage and pram i am absolutely frustrated upset and disappointed i can see that british-airways do not care about mothers with kids at all
  for this flight from heathrow t5 passengers were piled into the bus and left for 30 mins at the terminal  very unhappy passengers  not and when confronted the ba transport manager's response was sorry  not we are still learning on arrival at the aircraft a gentleman who came on a wheelchair had no help with his luggage i helped shame  not since lounge service was very good for the flight out from munich ba had not re signed up to the now open lounge in munich to me looks like a systemic failing rather than a  off event
 ba encourage you to download verifly to speed up your check notin this is absolutely rubbish as the desk staff dont seem to want this they want to see the actual forms tests etc this wasted about 40 minutes and is pointless the return flight again had no access to the club lounge you pay for extras such as this as part of the business class ticket price and should by now be made available again last 2 flight not available at nce but this is more a part of the covid experience on board staff were good although  did joke to another welcome to ryanair on board food was very good for a short haul flight
  they cancelled a flight i booked three months ago for some operational problem at a time where the prices are off the roof british-airways could not give me any alternatives other than refund or a voucher 
  ive been flying with ba for years and never had any issues i recently had to arrange to have surgery in budapest and naturally wanted to fly ba so i booked my flights from bhd to bud via lhr online on their site once booked i informed the hospital and confirmed my appointment the very next day i received an email from ba telling me they had cancelled my flight to bud but not to worry as they had moved me to an earlier a much earlier flight the same day only problem was this earlier flight departed around two hours before my flight from bhd arrived i  have thought that this  have flashed up on their system as being an issue but seemingly not… *interlude* to  into hungary during covid  needs a valid reason with medical treatment being  i had to fill in a very confusing form on the hungarian police website that was a confusing mix of hungarian and pidgin english anyway form filled in with flight numbers etc emailed to the authorities there and exemption granted so i took the earlier flight but this meant i had to fly into london the previous evening and stay overnight in a hotel so operation booked hotel booked airport transfers booked immigration papers amended and re sent and admiration granted and flights re booked what could go wrong around three weeks before i was due to travel ba rather unsportingly decided to cancel my flight to bud again needless to say i was furious i complained to ba customer services and was given a stock excuse about covid disrupting air travel great excuse only having looked at bud arrivals info ryanair had been flying there once daily for at least the preceding several months so bas covid excuse rang somewhat hollow epilogue: i got refunded most of my my from the flights i booked with ba although they refused to refund my bhd  not lhr flights because who knows i also lost the my i had spent on a hotel and half of the my i had spent on booking airport transfers given the cavalier attitude ba seem to have to bookings and their indifference to ruining weeks of preparation on my part and the fact that i lost a not inconsiderable sum of my ive decided to avoid ba from now on
  check in well organised no lounge in cancun efficient boarding process given water bottle before take off no welcome drink now covid rules are being relaxed this needs to change menu good and food acceptable staff were experienced and well organised and gave a very slick on board experience managed to sleep a few hours for the first time my tagged luggage was off quickly this may reflect the fact that our flight was the only  into gatwick at that time
  departure lgw north so aspire lounge bag from fine lounge british-airwayssic on time departure cabin crew welcoming but only given menu water and amenity pack looks like some of white company bedding options removed lunch was fine and good pre meal drinks service not complete return to old days but ting there flight generally good early touch down club world luggage off last which meant a wait of 75 minutes for luggage
  booked flight six months before travel then month before the flight ba cancelled the flight giving the option to rebook for another day  not bearing in mind that people have work and school that was not ideal on top of booked parking for over three weeks we rebooked the flight not as suggested by them and a week later ba cancelled the rebooked flight we were told that we will receive a refund within 10 working days over two weeks passed and i called again i was informed that they ca not give a time frame for processing refunds and no refund issued yet ba representative refuses to give contact details to the manager they cut the ph 
  the airline cancelled my initial return flight with a 2 hours layover in london and my only option was to book the next flight that has a 7 not8 hours layover that's before i board the flight to toronto while i understand schedule changes and do my best to stay positive and supportive i contacted the airline asking for upgrades to a best seat i asked for access to the airport lounge during my prolonged stay in the airport they denied my ask no explanations and no empathy not only that but they ignored my subsequent ask to provide a path to escalation again not the change in schedule not the extra 5 hours layover time just the way they chose to treat a customer who did not do anything wrong except trusting them with his commute 
  i was traveling with my wife in business class from seattle to bangalore via connecting flight in london and we reserved our seats toher while booking the tickets but mysteriously they changed it later and when we got our boarding pass they assigned 11h and 5d called several times but they could not do anything and gave us explanations like may be some  else needed those seats and there are no other seats toher available when we boarded the whole plane was empty and still they did not allow us to seat toher 
  i usually avoid ba because of its appalling customer service and sneaky extra charges but this flight was my only option note that ba actually charges for seat pre notselection in biz class  not not 100 uk pounds in this case does any other airline in the world dare do that i saved the my and waited until checkin to choose my seat for free the seats were ba's universally derided cramped 6 notacross british-airwaysck notto notfront configuration where you stare into the face of your seat mate an arm's length away no other airline ever came up with this awkward arrangement  not not not i wonder why no preflight drink was offered at meal time i selected  of the three main offerings only to be told it was not available  not not even though there were only 3 people in my 16 seat biz section the seat area has practically no storage except a tiny drawer at ankle level that is inaccessible when the seat is in lie flat position the bed is the narrowest i have experienced in biz class and is also very hard the cabin was very cold and the blanket very thin; i had to raid blankets from two other seats just to stay warm the amenity kit is the smallest i've ever seen in biz class  not not it fits in the palm of the hand all in all this uncomfortable miserly experience is hardly worth the £5727 that ba charges for this route i used miles to pay for my ticket  not not but of course got whacked with ba's unique and notorious fuel surcharge fee of $636 for using miles
  aktion airport has only recently opened its new facilities and check notin and departure certainly seemed very clean and efficient although admittedly its only having to cope with a low passenger load at present it was good to see that check notin carefully scrutinised lateral flow certificates and passenger locator forms thanks to just 30 passengers on board with more than half in club europe the flight took off ahead of time service was a little perfunctory and the food was more reminiscent of economy than business class with too much pre notpackaging  not the covid effect presumably arrival into t5 was also comfortably ahead of schedule and although we were dreading many hours of queuing at border control we were through the e notgates and collecting our luggage just 20 minutes after landing
  i want to say a big thank you to kahina ladjouze after frustratingly missing my flight due to m25 road closures she helped me secure and book the next day flight without additional charges i am really grateful
 after sixteen months of being grounded by covid it felt almost surreal to be british-airwaysck in t5 heading for what to us was essential summer sun in greece t5 was blissfully quiet with no queues at check notin or security and even the galleries south lounge was less frenetic than usual despite families with kids similarly desperate to escape boris johnsons bully boy attitude ordering food and beverages from s table seems something worth continuing avoiding all the wastage of endlessly replenished buffets the flights was very quiet with just 30 pax on board 9 of whom were in club europe boarding by row also seemed a welcome improvement on the previous ‘groups service on the flight was good and the food was of the usual do&co quality landing was ahead of schedule and we were through passport control in just a few minutes after a quick check of vaccination certificates and the passenger locator form overall a thoroughly reassuring coming out of covid experience
 ba cancelled flight in dec 2020 refund was promised in voucher form by call center we are now 6 months down the line 13 calls of which each is 40 min waiting time and 16 email reminders conclusion is that they are just going in circles to avoid issuing any voucher head of call center is keeping to her empty promises
 fantastic flight down to heathrow crew doing their best to keep every happy in challenging times nice to see they have introduced a free snack and water its a start
  boarding and disembritish-airwaysrking were greatly organised: passengers were boarded at the gate by seperate rows from the british-airwaysckside to the front business minimizing the possiblity for jamming same at disembritish-airwaysrking: passengers were asked to remain seated then row per row was called crew members were supporting the process what could be improved: distribute hand notsanitizer during boarding when snack was distributed my row #8 business was overlooked for some reason; after a while my seat neighbour highlighted that we did not  food  not staff was surprised and fixed it this was my first flight since  year and i appreciated the covid measures taken by ba  not still it left some strange experience
 this was not my best experience with ba thus far as there were a couple of disappointments i was happy with the fast british-airwaysggage check notin this was a bus gate which is not my favourite thing but not a blemish on the airline the covid protocols are not as robust as they should be particularly attendants need to be armed with sanitizer at the cabin entrance there was a big mix up which i find inexcusable  not i and another passenger were allocated the same seat on the same plane causing a few anxious moments and the friendly attendant had to  me another seat but i do not expect such at this level bottles of water were offered to every passenger which was welcome the plane arrived 10 minutes late
  ok flight apart from they cancelled the majority of the outbound and crammed everybody on  flight after having my return cancelled 3 times i opted for a voucher so i could rebook a new route i had not been informed before requesting the “e notvoucher” and i  need to call up to rebook im in a different country and the ph tariffs are extortion so not only was my flight cancelled 3 times i wasnt offered an option to rebook a new flight online i was inconvenienced every step of the way
 absolutely appalling experience british-airways unfortunately has lowered it's standards and to my dismay i've been recently having a much better flying experience with bud airlines rather than ba customer service representatives are completely clueless unprofessional and not bothered  i recently had my flight cancelled on 3 occasions and the staff were not interested in helping me return home
 had booked the above mentid flight but the travel restrictions changed a week before the travel dates the airline didnt notify me until i learned that i could not fly with the airlines only at the airport when i went for check notin it was a single ticket with the company and they said they did not realise i was flying from canada to india via london the restrictions did not allow any via flights but were ok with direct s when i booked a single ticket from canada to india how come they did not realise i could not fly no refund at all gave me a credit for me to travel anytime in the next two years but i do not have any travel plans for the next two years that means my my is g when talking to representatives they ridiculously put everything on the website agents which was 'onetravel' the worst experience ever with an airline am a frequent flyer was trying ba for the first time but now i guess i am never going to fly with you on my return journey the other flight gave me a full refund when the new travel restrictions did not allow them to take me a poor show with ba
  my return flight from antigua to london was cancelled 2 times when i call to ba several times their computer system didnt work and they couldnt issue new ticket as the result i had to pay airport price for british-airwaysggage as i couldnt pay online without ticket they promised to give me compensation of hotel stay food and travel if complete online form when i d it i was asked to submit expenses but link provided was to lost british-airwaysggage expenses not what i claimed i replied that link is wrong and asked for correct link they replied that they nt compensate anything 
  4 cancellations for 1 month applying vouchers only to find out they do not work after new cancellation terrible stammers do not recommend to any in covid restrictions
  i had travelled to india for an eye surgery on my flight british-airwaysck to london heathrow i was assisted by a member of the cabin crew madeline thomas she was an amazing person as she made sure i was feeling okay as i had come british-airwaysck from my surgery and was traveling by myself she was more then a nurse and took care of my needs like a mom she also made sure i had eaten my food and stood by next to me as i was feeling awful because i was in lot of pain
  i was travelling british-airwaysck from mexico city on a business trip fully aware of the covid safety restrictions at the moment which the staff do an admirable job with  not but nevertheless a lot to say on the state of ba first at the moment firstly  not no lounge at all at mexico city terminal 2 there's a paid lounge but the check in staff  not help with the details mexico city terminal 1 has functional lounges for aeromexico working not good enough for an expensive ticket finally got to board and the staff are incredible  not but throughout they were super apoloic as to what was to come the food was literally inedible in first and staff offered commented as much every time so for an 11 hour trip in first the option really was chocolate or crisps the first suite on the flight had visible signs of wear and tear and needs some attention the seat  not easily convert to a bed it had scuff marks around it and generally looked a bit shabby again not what you'd expect from a premium product i left my watch on the flight in error and contacted ba immediately about this despite assurances that they have a comprehensive cleaning process during covid my watch was never found ba has outsourced their lost and found service to a separate company and in the process they have completely washed their hands on helping out customers given that i told them specifically where i'd left the watch i can only assume that  of the cleaning staff decided to keep it all in all you pay premium on a flight for additional service ba is not offering it at the moment if it is essential that you have to fly really do not bother with first unless you have to  not or go to another airline the company just do not care
  charge £700 fee to make an amendment to a booked holiday well in advance absolutely disgraceful their site says £30 fees for amendments and when you ring up they say that you ticked the terms and conditions box and refer to page 27 of terms and conditions and use it to charge you an extortionate amount  i received nothing but british-airwaysd attitude and rudeness from the representative
  good service the whole way nothing exceptional but it was only a short flight plane was clean and refreshments were provided my only issue is that the flight was packed  not understandable as it was just before chirstmas but surely it is not wise to have strangers sitting so close to each other during a pandemic even with the masks my return flight was cancelled but it was easy to transfer to a new flight so no issues there either  not just hoping for a little more personal space next time also wi notfi did not work i also liked that they had a system for boarding and disembritish-airwaysrking to avoid every rushing at the same time brought in for the pandemic i'm sure but i hope this is something they continue into the future as it made the experience much more pleasant value for my marked down only because the christmas flights were so expensive to be expected though i know
  i entered the plane with a bunch of white flowers and a flight attendant joked that i should have felt obliged to bring the flowers when she realized that i was going to my mother's funeral with the flowers she was apoloic she had no idea why i was bringing in flowers but the crew were very nice to me during this flight
  i was supposed to fly with aeroflot on the 23rd of december to moscow but because russia has closed its borders like the majority of other countries the flight was canceled and i couldnt  home ive also tried to fly through antalya but the same situation occurred on my third try i came to heathrow and tried to fly away to cairo i was declined by another company then i went to british-airways starting from testing because egypt requires tests as stressful as the whole situation was the employees were outstanding im not sure is it connected to ba but still i want to mention this the crew was very helpful and extremely understanding very professional and urgent to help they have been a great help and i am very gracious for this i want to separately point out  employee  not shanell if i am not mistaken who works at collision testing center in heathrow terminal 5 she is a savior and most importantly a human which is very rare nowadays carrying on i went to ba check notin but unfortunately couldnt do it as my results didnt go through yet however another outstanding employee who provided great help called her colleagues and arranged for the booking to be frozen until the results arrive ive come to her 3 times with additional questions and every time she was very patient professional and happy to help after i got my results i came british-airwaysck to heathrow on 24th but unfortunately there were no flights to cairo the situation became even more complicated i will spare the details however here again brilliant employees of ba offered their personal assistance and showed sympathy and humanity towards me the nicest lady ive ever met unfortunately i didnt catch her name but i am aware it was her first day at ba and that she is egyptian followed me throughout my struggles offered me emotional and professional support she tried to find any possible ways for me to  british-airwaysck home and actually did she was open to any kind of help and was enormously helpful for which i cant thank her enough she also asked her colleague to help me which he kindly did  lastly the nice lady shame i dont know her name also shared my struggles with her colleague mani who came to substitute her on the position he was very friendly and attentive as well talked me through the process offered different ways i can stay at the airport gave his ph to call and offered to drop me off at the hotel which he did not have to do whatsoever to conclude i merely want to thank all of these individuals  more time as they have been a great help both in physical and mental aspects i hstly do not know what  i do if i havent met them i dont know was i just lucky to meet these people or all ba employees are of the same morality but i do want to thank ba for hiring and providing jobs for these great human beings as well as upholding the standard for other airlines for some people the help that was provided to me might seem like a normal thing to do however for me it was a pleasant and so much needed surprise as no  in
  dubritish-airwaysi to london on 5th december flight was ok  not seat comfortable enough crew reasonably friendly but my food was gross  both flights almost full with little social distancing and plenty of mixed groups sat next to each other lots of passengers with masks below nose or not on at all when coming british-airwaysck to heathrow many seemed to have below their nose announcement made at the beginning about masks crew challenged a couple of people at beginning of flight for not having them on or below nose but seemed to give up at the end when leaving plane good number had already taken off yet nothing on way british-airwaysck not a single maskless or incorrectly worn mask challenged a guy opposite me had his mask below nose the whole flight he had a conversation with several attendants neither of whom said anything  not like the crew were busy either did 2 services the whole flight then rest of the time didnt see them of course flying in these times is a risk but those risks can be reduced by passengers wearing masks enforced by the airlines
 this is my first flight since january we have had three cancellations which ba handled superbly but this flight went ahead check in at lhr was fine no fast track se unity at t5 galleries south lounge open they have an app system it seemed to work well and my breakfast arrived quickly followed this with a shower they are open notlimited hours flight on time and well presented a321 staff worked hard nice drinks run the packed lunch was not dissimilar to the old short haul economy product but was fine in these times landed on time priority british-airwaysggage cane off late overall happy with product and  use again
  i had a direct flight from london to lahore and travelling with them was a nightmare they did not have milk for my son's bottle did not even give warm water for his formula milk no kids meals no snacks meal portion size was tiny 1/4 glass of juice you literally have to beg them for drinks water etc staff was so rude and treated us like trash if you compare them with emirates i  give emirates 10/10 and british airways 2/10 it's not at all child friendly i will never travel with them again
  overall i have to say i am really pleased with the service ba provided given the circumstances which must be particularly challenging for airlines i had to call ba a few times regarding both my outbound and return flight and i  rate their customer service 10/10 every i talked to was extremely friendly and helpful  employee even tried to help me figure out the recently updated arrival regulations from an italian website and listened to my rant about constantly changing restrictions and quarantines i was refunded promptly for part of my flight that had been cancelled and i was able to change my return flight to a completely different route and date with only a minimal charge they have really shown flexibility here which is needed when travelling in 2020 the flight itself was fine and i appreciate that food and drink options are currently a bit limited given that every should wear their mask as much as possible rather than sipping tea the  thing  not which i mean as constructive criticism though  not i think ba could improve is a little more exchange with their destination airports the arrival sheets for italy we were given on the flight were outdated and the ground staff in heathrow in charge of the boarding procedure did not even know that swab tests were now mandatory for arrivals in italy when i asked him whether he knew any details of what to expect in venice that's fine on the first day after yet another update but this rule had been in place for 4 days on the day i travelled overall my experience with ba was very positive though and i am happy to spend a little more on my flight than i  with some cheaper airlines for the great customer service i received
 i am extremely pleased with british-airways as they refunded my tickets munich notlondon city notmunich within 2 working days in a friendly and professional manner: the difference between british-airways and lufthansa is night and day friendly professional and prompt are 3 adjectives to describe ba while lufthansa is best summed up as arrogant impossible to contact and ignorant well d and best wishes to all at british-airways
  boarding and checkin formalities are very nice check in help desk was very helpful and supportive everything was nice except food i am vegan and there was no food availability for vearian passengers if not pre notordered my flight was 10 hour journey from london to bangalore and i was hungry
  i have always had great flights with british-airways but this time the experience was absolutely amazing as this was my 100th flight i decided to celebrate it in club europe which turned out to be a perfect decision the stewards working in club made me feel special and delivered a professional and personalised service and were kind and chatty although the cabin crew was the best part of the flight other features didnt let me down either efficient business class check in at warsaw cosy executive lounge preludium with attentive and helpful staff well organised boarding although no priority for club europe because of corona the aircraft was very fresh and clean seats were comfortable with enough legroom adjustable headrests and power ports the on board service is different than before corona times but its still very good tasty lunch box from do&co with fresh chicken sandwich oriental veable salad and and amazing chocolate mousse the choice of drinks was wide including a very good quality champagne from nicolas feuillatte all in all a perfect flight experience with british-airways everything i expected from this flight was fulfilled the  thing i can complain about is british-airwaysggage handling at heathrow we waited around 50 mins for luggage and they were also delivered irrespecutful of club europe priority
  we had a flight to santorini from lhr at 8:10am as the flight was full we had to check in all our luggage we arrived at the airport at 7:00am and the queue for check notin was incredibly long because some desks were closed it took us over 40 minutes to arrive to a desk and when we arrived we were told that the check notin had closed at 7:25am and that we had missed the flight british-airways staff did not offer us to jump the queue at anytime the lady at the desk booked us on a flight to athens instead telling us that the costs to reach santorini  be reimbursed we had to book two tickets worth £200 for a flight to santorini on the same day we have just received a response from the customer relations service telling us that we   nothing 
  my flight from los angeles to paris via london was delayed due to late inbound aircraft due to mechanical and so i missed my connexion in london and arrived in paris 3'25 late and missed my onward connexion on air france and had to overnight on my own dime in paris i applied for compensation lawfully due me through ec261 but their customer relations department refused by carelessly determining that my flight had arrived in london under the 3 nothour delay window for compensation even though my final was clearly paris and their cr agent acknowledged this after i pointed out the error she ignored me so i filed a claim with the centre for effective dispute resolution and ba sent them a defences they claim i traveled on af65 and arrived in london ahead of schedule the truth is that ba at lax rebooked and reticketed me on that flight however af refused to accept me and my british-airwaysggage unless i paid them a surcharge so ba then rebooked me on flights to have me arrive very late into paris and misconnect and have to overnight there i do not know which is more shocking that ba  lie to the authorities in order to support their indefensible position or that their agents do not know how to read a passenger name record's air history
  i was deeply unimpressed with the lack of social distancing on my flight the plane to london was 90% or more full and no social distancing could be applied a number of people wearing face masks incorrectly over mouth or as a chinstrap throughout the flight and there was a fair amount of time when masks were off for the free snack small british-airwaysg of crisps and 250ml of water  it seems crazy to allow a considerate amount of time with masks off or inappropriately worn in such a small space with no safe distance whatsoever also only the absolute minimum of service which given covid is understandable but makes the flight really boring  not or not since some excitement was provided by turbulence with very little information from the flight deck disembritish-airwaysrkation was chaotic to say the least but terminal 5 was empty and vast enough to allow to finally distance an upgrade for 89 euros  was was available but it did not seem to make sense at least they departed on time and the plane appeared reasonably clean
 newcastle to london heathrow with british-airways i was pleasantly surprised plane was on time and spotlessly clean professional staff; bottle of water crackers and crisps handed out lovely deplaning with special covid social distancing system working well
  due to the coronavirus situation i bought a return ticket british-airwaysck to my home country singapore from london where i currently reside because the first wave of asia in march was d i was due to fly british-airwaysck to london on 25th august 2020 and my flight got cancelled before my flight cancellation i got an email from the airline that i could apply for a voucher if my flight ever got cancelled so i applied for an online voucher but i was told that i am not eligible to  a voucher because i have d the london to singapore leg a month later i tried again to redeem for a voucher and somehow i was successful but to redeem the voucher i have to call to redeem the voucher which i think it is a complete joke and i was put on hold for many hours
  british-airways canceled my flight to london on june 3 due to covid not19 it is july 23 and they still have not refunded my my i've reached out to executives after trying the usual customer service path nothing has worked they will not call me and will not provide me any resolution they are blatantly ignoring emails asking for help avoid british-airways service is non notexistent and they will keep your my they are keeping almost $3000us of our my
  london to frankfurt i made the mistake of exchanging my april flights with ba for a voucher because of the travel disruption due to the pandemic big mistake ba has failed completely and does not seem to care i tried to book an august flight using the voucher but frlights cannot be booked online using a voucher you have to wait for hours on the ph to speak to some customer service tried to charge me twice the original cost then no email confirmation for hours after i chased it up another long wait on hold email confirmation showed they had booked the wrong outbound date  not service supervisor denied any error on their part and refused to rebook for correct date or give a refund a few days later i started all over again and booked an alternative outbound date still not the  i wanted but better  not and 3 weeks later ba cancelled the return flight so i called for a refund to be told if it has not appeared in my account after 21 days to  british-airwaysck in touch  things go wrong it's how you deal with problems that mark out good customer service ba has not a clue
 ba cancelled my flight to lyon march/april 2020 because of the corona crisis i could not obtain a refund as the ba website and teleph service made this impossible it just sent me round in circles so i opted for a future travel voucher as this could be obtained via the website i have now tried to use the voucher for a flight to munich and was informed by the website that i have to call ba for this the silver card member ph number is inaccessible as ba has reduced teleph access to  number i have now called this number five times each time i was told to call at another time as 'in these difficult times they had to protect staff' this is exactly the same message that i received the many times i called for a refund is ba not honouring their voucher system trying to fob off customers and keep their my this is appalling business practice
  a short hop from london to edinburgh in november 2019  not efficient clean and punctual the airport experience was straightforward and i think flying from city you  simplicity but miss out on the bigger aircraft which are a bit more comfortable i got my luggage quickly at the other end and i appreciated having a wide range of flight times to choose from
  total rip off british-airways cancels flights due to pandemic covid 19 when i use the voucher they issued me they want me to pay a additional $1000 for a first class seat british-airways way to rip people off and profit from a world pandemic 
  i booked flights to rome from the us and then home through london to lax in february of this year for the 1st of august i booked through american airlines and then i paid for seat selection for 3 people through the ba website paying us $951 in total with the pandemic it is now impossible for me and my group to travel to italy and england on this trip as 1 we are not allowed to travel outside the us 2 as americans we are not allowed to travel to italy or england and 3 the us government has not processed  of the passport renewal we need to fly which was mailed in early february i had to cancel all of our hotels airb&bs car and train reservations over the last week in order to qualify to obtain refunds and/or vouchers ive tried to reach british-airways customer service a number of times finally got through today after an hour on hold i asked how to obtain a refund or voucher for the business class seat selection that i had paid for and was told that i will lose the my i paid that there are no refunds or vouchers allowed because i booked the trip through american airlines and not through british-airways my understanding is that ba and aa have a partnership that should make it relatively seamless to book and travel on either or both partners though i was shocked at having to pay nearly $1000 just to reserve our seats in business class but this is apparently not the case i was told that if ba cancels the two flights that we are booked on that i might be able to  either a voucher or a refund i was prepared today to accept a voucher that i could use when i rebook this trip for 2021 as i understand that ba and all airlines are suffering financially as much as i am but i was not prepared to be totally ripped off by ba i cannot wait until the first flight is supposed to fly august 1st to cancel this as i will lose the my and miles i paid american airlines for this flight i am at a loss as to what i can do to handle a situation that is totally out of my control and for which an airline partner that i valued traveling on is refusing to offer a voucher or a refund i will never again do anything that gives revenue to british-airways
  i booked a trip to spain for mid notmarch 2020 with american airlines british-airways and iberia i needed to cancel this flight due to the pandemic and travel british-airwaysn to europe that began in march i was able to change my flight at no cost which is great but given the fact that my flight left the day the travel british-airwaysn began those tickets should have been refunded if i were to have boarded that flight i  have been quarantined in europe and  have faced a mandatory quarantine upon re notentry to the us if i were able to return at all the fact that british-airways did not cancel this flight is beyond me since i do not know who in their right mind  have traveled to spain with the travel british-airwaysn enforced the response i received from british-airways is that it does not matter the reason unless they cancel the flight no refund or voucher is available i'm very disappointed in the response from them during a globritish-airwaysl pandemic and will not book another flight with them
  i booked london to tel aviv in jan 2020 to attend a school reunion i booked economy ba then sent me an upgrade offer which i accepted at an additional £500 so i  fly premium in the new plane covid hit and they cancelled the flight no fault of theirs their subsequent behaviour was all their fault after a mammoth effort to contact them i was offered a full refund this took months and many calls to  and they deducted £150 as a service fee for the upgrade calls and e notmails all result in the same robotic response as you made a post booking change we are unable to offer a full refund 
  i booked my hymoon flight from san diego to barcelona in september 2020 i have since needed to cancel this flight due to the pandemic and the uncertainty of travel especially to other countries i was able to change my flight at no cost which is great however this is my hymoon and i paid in advance for seats to ensure i sat next to my  be wife this was more than $1000 in additional cost the response i received from british-airways is that it does not matter the reason unless they cancel the flight no refund or voucher is available i then asked if i wanted to make sure i sat next to my  be wife they expected me to pay again the answer was yes i'm very disappointed in the response from them during a globritish-airwaysl pandemic where travel is not safe and we have no idea when it will be safe again
  this company is withholding my my after cancelling my flight due to the pandemic and have issued me a voucher even though i called to explain why a voucher is useless since we are under a travel british-airwaysne initially they had said no refunds the only thing to do was  a voucher after we had ordered they announce you can  refund if flight is cancelled and you dont have voucher 
  tokyo to london 12 hours without anything to eat because the sandwich i was given was inedible there was no british-airwaysr service and soft drinks were pitiful with orange running out after a matter of hours total waste of my having paid for premium economy i am aware it was the beginning of the covid19 issues but the situation was appalling and has been made worse by a total lack of follow up service from british-airways their attitude is unacceptable  not it is all about my with them 
  flight ba 282 on 11 february was delayed 173 mins due to mechanical in london and so i misconnected at london heathrow and arrived 3 hrs 25 mins late i requested compensation and was refused  not for three e notmails they told me my flight to london was delayed 173 mins under the 180 mins floor and i continued to reply that i did not fly to london but to paris and arrived 205 mins late then they started writing that i was able to make my original connexion which is untrue i do not know whether to fault their greed at persisting in this lie or their incompetence
  london heathrow to toronto my wife and i used avios and the ba amex companion voucher to  a very good deal to fly business class on our holiday i was also excited to fly on an a350 for the first time and it definitely lived up to my expectations the breakfast buffet in the ba lounge in heathrow t5 was okay not amazing and there was a good range of drinks and comfortable settees the aircraft felt very clean and fresh and had good mood lighting very comfortable spacious seats and large high notresolution ife screens i like the moving map but my wife opted for the movies and was impressed with the selection available we both enjoyed the food and wines on board and it was a professional and friendly service from the cabin crew the a350 is a lot quieter than older aircraft like the 747 and 777
  my wife and i used avios and my ba amex companion voucher to  a very good deal for business class flights to our holiday before the coronavirus lockdown was on the horizon the check notin and security were very efficient and the lounge not belonging to ba was clean but had a more limited range of food than i  have expected boarding was very quick and cabin crew were friendly and professional i am a big fan of the iconic 747 but we flew out on  of ba's new a350's and this brought home to me that the 747 business class is looking tired and old in comparison the seats were comfortable and the food was good but small and very low quality ife screen was behind the times however it was a night flight so i slept most of the journey except when there was moderate turbulence caused by strong tail notwinds
  i flew with ba recently from sydney to london deciding to return british-airwaysck home from travelling due to the coronavirus situation the first ticket i booked with them was via hong kong after booking hk closed it's borders so i could no longer  this flight i rang up ba who advised that the hk flight was not yet cancelled on the system so they could not yet book me onto a new flight yet the customer service agent assured me he  ring me british-airwaysck at 11am the next day as it  be cancelled on the system by then and he  tell me what flight ba  be putting me on as a replacement 11am came and went the next day and i had not received a ph call i tried ringing to find out what was going on and was on hold for 5 hours and still no  answered i decided to book myself onto another flight as there were hardly any left available and i did not want to end up stuck in australia i had not received the promised ph call or even an email to tell me what my replacement flight  be so felt i had no other choice when i got british-airwaysck home i raised this with ba they told me that i was supposed to process an 'involuntary change' to  a replacement flight  not that is not what the customer agent advised me i'd never even heard that term before he simply said ba  sort it out and put me on a replacement flight he did not say i had to do anything so now because i was given the incorrect advice i am out of pocket by a considerable amount i raised it with the ba complaints team that i had been advised incorrectly and if i had been told i needed to do an involuntary change myself i  have d so they were extremely unhelpful and just said that they do not know why i was advised incorrectly and there is nothing they can do about it when i said that was not good enough they british-airwayssically just fobbed me off and told me to go to a third party adjudicator if i wanted but they were not prepared to do anything  i will never use this airline again
  during the time of covid not19 it is normal that a airline has to cancel their flight im ok with that also when it means that i had to reorganize a few things whats definitely is not okay is the compensation via voucher  not you cant use their voucher online or for a cheap flight  not on the hotline they offer you no online fare and just way more expensive prices so stay far away from their voucher for me as a regular traveler i will avoid ba as much as possible in the future i even wont use my miles with ba
  do not accept a british-airways e notvoucher go for a refund i stupidly accepted 2 e notvouchers and they are a waste of time they have no flexibility and despite the fact that ba has my and air miles belonging to me i cannot redeem the voucher against a more expensive non air miles flight only an air miles flight that they do not have available at the time and route i want ba are trying every trick in the book to complicate frustrate and make rebooking difficult and worse still you ca not redeem the cancelled flight voucher online only by speaking to the call centre which means hanging on for an hour or so every time you try to 'ph them i was a loyal silver card executive club member and still am but after ba's approach i will be avoiding them wherever possible in future
  london notheathrow to warsaw on 14th march british-airways stands out in many areas of the flight experience starting from check in and ending on the deplaning very friendly smiling chatty people throughout my journey including the lovely captain who gave all the information about delay missed slot and new departure time what is also really appreciated in those coronavirus times he entered the passenger cabin before takeoff without any mask whatsoever and assured us this aircraft is so modern and has such good air filters that we are safe here the boarding procedure was very well organised no chaos with 5 groups boarding sequentially i did not try the paid marks&spencer on board service but i think it  be a nice touch to  some refreshments free the  thing i can pick on is the cleanliness of the rear toilet whilst the rest of the cabin was impeccably clean the toilet was filthy 
 just before the borders were closed in south africa due to corona virus i went to the airport to find out if the flight scheduled will fly as planned there was no international flight customer service staff available so i was not able to  a response the only number available was a uk number which will cost me more than a flight to enquire next day i managed to  on board the flight sadly due to my fault i forgot my laptop inside the aircraft on arrival to terminal 5 i was  of the last passengers to leave the plane i realised my mistake after i passed security and i was not allowed british-airwaysck into the airport to collect my laptop which is fair enough and i understand why i could not go british-airwaysck to the aircraft they gave me a number to call and i have been calling the number since march so far it has been zero positive response because they are using a third party company to help you which has zero interest to help you find your lost items basically ba does not have means in place for passengers to find their items my laptop was left inside the flight hence it is impossible for crew staff and cleaning staff to not find it hence i just can not understand how they can not find it bearing in mind it was 100% left inside the plane lessons learned avoid if you can 
  at check notin desk at t5 heathrow was told by ba staff that sweden only allowing swedish nationals into country this was contrary to advice on swedish government website  i rang the border control office at arlanda airport they confirmed that eu/efta/eea & uk nationals were clear to enter the country i offered the ph to ba staff to clear up any confusion they declined and then changed their story saying it was their own company policy i spent the next hour trying to  through to ba on the teleph for a refund the calls were being disconnect due to high call volumes  ba standard of service compared to the other major european airlines was dishst and obstructive furthermore if the other airlines can provide customer support on the teleph or via email at this time ba should be able to do the same while in notflight staff at ba are still terrific they are let down by the worst sort of management bureaucracy
  i booked a flight with them on 26 of march but was unable to flight to the destination due to coronavirus restrictions since then i am trying to call them every day i also filled out the form to request a refund but no reply in a week today i finally managed to spoke to the lady on the ph from their cs but she just directed me to their website or she gave me another number this number directed me to call again the first number i called already after minutes of waiting again i spoke to another lady she asked me for my reference and said she will transfer me to some else when she hang up on me unbelievable so you can not even call them and when you finally speak with some no help at all i never thought company like this have this poor customer service especially in situation like this with the corona virus
  a journey of 2 halves before hand multiple lies and lack of information from the ba website they cancelled my flight but they were not hst about what they had d and lied they claimed that i could re notbook and showed lots of flights  not n were in fact scheduled to fly but ba claimed that they were full then my return booking completely disappeared and the website claimed that all journeys complete website at no point gave any indication about how difficult it was ting to fly from the usa to uk impossible to  through to ba in london usa ba much better  not a total wait of 1 hour 40 minutes to make 2 calls staff at the call centre efficient and helpful chaos at chicago as most passengers had american issued boarding passes for the ba flight to london and ba were not accepting those boarding passes no explanation for the change in policy every i saw merely handed in the american boarding pass and was given a ba boarding pass on the plane the staff were excellent  not as usual food was good  not verging on very good breakfast a little small but tasty i even got a 2nd cup of tea journey smooth with some sleep i stopped flying ba for 10 years because the head office is so poor  not the staff on the ground are good but ba as an organisatiion comes over as british-airwaysdly managed: eg over securing client's data telling passengers what is going on running a decent frequent flier programme design of the business cabin stepping over the legs of the next passenger to go to the loo and so on i only fly ba because of the lack of choice on most routes  not whenever there is an alternative i try that not american airlines which somehow is consistently poorer than ba
  i flew to vancouver mid march to see my mother then in hospital three days after arrival my mother passed away and i subsequently needed tochange my return flight to be able to attend her funeral i tried to manage my booking online as ba suggest but because i had bought a package that included car hire the ba site said i was unable to change this online and i had to call their customer services i spent over 19 hours hanging on a teleph trying to call the numbers listed online  i set up conversations facebook and twitter they went unanswered on the second day of my teleph ordeal i actually called a different number and spoke to a guy in ‘holidays who said he couldnt help me either but that he  try and add me to the queue for the help line when this was finally answered after another hour and a half of waiting i managed to blurt out my ref number nothing else… before that call was disconnected thankfully the  person i had briefly spoken to in the duty office that night then emailed me british-airwaysck and i was able to have a conversation about my need to change flight this change took about 10 not15 minutes over a few emails but the person helping me couldnt extend the car hire because the vehicle had already been collected the only way this could be managed  be by myself calling the car hire company but two days previously when i tried to manage my booking online i was told i couldnt do this because i had bought a package and that this could only be d by ba i do totally understand the turmoil caused by covid not19 but never again ba
  very disappointed that ba are not making it straightforward to claim a refund on cancelled flights british-airwaysck due to covid not19 effectively holding onto my my illegally do whats right and make it straightforward to do it online a voucher is not sufficient or  more ph operators the virus is stressful enough without you making to check your site for updates and a 2 hour wait on the ph very disappointed  not i expect much better from you
  i booked my flights to the uk in may 2019 and had to cancel our trip to the uk on march 12 2020  4 days prior to leaving because a travel british-airwaysn was going to start on march 16 2020 and because i am older and have pre notexisting health conditions my doctor asked me to postp our trip the british-airways customer care associates i talked with were great and caring and they were able to issue us travel credit for tickets that were non notrefundable now the problem is i need to rebook and use the travel credit by may 2020 for travel to the uk by may 2021 or lose all the credit from our trip how can i make travel arrangements by may 2020 with the coronavirus out of control throughout the world and travel british-airwaysns in place i understand ba has policies in place but i cannot understand how you can expect some to make travel arrangements while the world is dealing with covid not19 i feel this timeline is unfair to any consumer who has trust with their preferred airline my preferred airline is still british-airways british-airways needs to reevaluate their policies during a world crisisand make adjustments as needed to be fair to consumers who trust them whether a consumer has purchased refundable or non notrefundable tickets should not matter because forcing a consumer to rebook while a world pandemic is happening and not adjusting your policies to the situation can change your loyal customers remember there are many other airlines out there to choose from the coronavirus is something that no  has any control of i guess the bottom line is i think british-airways needs to put some common sense to their policy i want to rebook and travel but i am hesitant to this at this time hopefully may 2020 this pandemic is over for all of us 
  mumbritish-airwaysi to london heathrow i wish to highly commend the professionalism of the stewards on this flight some had errously accused me of being on a flight from goa to mumbritish-airwaysi and coughing throughout the journey categorically i was not on that flight but in his agitation the passenger could not hear me when i repeatedly said so the stewards dealt with this situation with tact absolute professionalism and great courtesy all the staff must be working in difficult circumstances at the moment they are putting themselves at more risk than most to ensure that holiday makers and business people can  home safely and i wish to thank our crew in particular for what they did
  i have a booking for march 19th london heathrow to valencia and ba still show this flight as operating and are not providing any refund option the ba website was updated on 17 march to state were working closely with the foreign & commonwealth office fco to continue flying where travel restrictions allow and where it is safe to do so i then checked the fco website that was also updated on 17 march and it states: the foreign and commonwealth office fco advises against all but essential travel to spain so it is clear that ba deem it safe to fly to spain despite the fco statement i know the airline is suffering like the rest of uk industry and business but how can they  away with such deceitful practices it is clear they are expecting customers to change their booking to the future and keep the funds and are not complying with the british fco advisory is this actually legal
 london gatwick to funchal british-airways are still forcing people to fly to madeira when the foreign office has advised against anything other than essential travel my wife and her friend were due to fly to madeira on 17 march for a week's holiday when we found out that the fo had advised against travelling there the madeira government had ruled that new arrivals  spend 14 days in quarantine no matter how long their stay that's a week longer than their proposed stay her friend contacted ba but was told they could not have a refund as the flight was still on they offered a voucher if this is an example of bas customer service i am not surprised they are in trouble
  lower deck club class seat with the current awful narrow business class facing seats british-airways premium passengers are treated with indifference at best and club class is simply terrible my food was not fit for consumption wifi broken crew morale low ife quality a british-airwaysd joke to add insult to injury the  amenity packs are contemptible what makes ba management think that business people require or indeed  retain a package of socks mask plastic pen and disposable tooth brush the ongoing decline of this once notgreat national airline is palpable 
  london to new york jfk another grim flight with british-airways in club class on a tired and old b747 not400 the business class at ba is by far the worst in the industry the dreaded ying / yang configuration is going to be with us for some time sadly in flight entertainment with tiny screen no hd and poor movie selection wifi did not work as usual food continues to be desperately poor and crew were rather keen to disappear quickly this airline needs major overhaul and investment in new aircraft and seats
  diabolical that british-airways are still forcing people to fly to madrid when other airlines have cancelled their flights and the foreign office have advised against anything other than essential travel what a way to treat their customers if that is how they are going to treat people it is hardly surprising they are in trouble
  frankfurt to buenos aires via london in october 2019 the aircraft is very old with small screens and ample entertainment which becomes an issue flying +10hrs the 1 hour layover was a complete disaster the staff was unfriendly and inconsiderate to me 
  london to paris return group booking cancelled i know the current coronavirus is causing problems for any airline but ba appears as usual to have no contingency plans to handle extra number of enquiries and it is proving impossible to speak with them after the constant it debritish-airwayscles this airline has surely it is time for heads at the top to roll cancelled my booking for flight refund online but they do not return the seat booking fee and you have to do this afterwards however the manage booking page wipes all preferences to your booked seat numbers and you cannot complete the form without this information a 5 year old child could improve upon the user unfriendly app and website that ba currently has and my patience of being loyal to ba for over 40 years i might add has run out the management of this airline appear to live in a conceited bubble and have no idea what is going on at the front line
  london city to berlin on 8th march flight got canceled the lady at the counter was extremely unfriendly and arrogant extremely rude staff and service this is no way to treat passengers especially not if the expensive flight is cancelled
  london to beijing in january 2020 ba has really upped their game now a few years british-airwaysck i took ba the experience was really disappointed and avoid them since however my recent flight is good the flight was delayed for 1 hour due to mechanical reasons but  british-airwaysck majority of the delay in the air food is tasty and crews are not hesitate to provide more if you are still hungry the drinks are offered in the promote manner and crews are really willing to engage with you in the gallery when majority of the passengers fall asleep seat is a bit tight but understood i am flying economy so this is bearable the return flight has been cancelled it takes like 10 calls / emails and they finally sorted out our flight this could be improved but i appreciate it is not easy to change you to an airline which is not ba's partner overall ba has really improved the game and the friendly and professional crews are the best in the world
  hong kong to london great airline indeed staff were friendly and helpful the aircraft was very clean the crews are diverse will definitely fly again
  mumbritish-airwaysi to london the check in process was quick efficient and friendly unfortunately there was a two hour delay on departure but ba kept us informed and we were given a free food and drink offering from the food court information explanation and apology over the delay was given by the first officer which we were happy with the entertainment screens were a little temperamental to begin with but they eventually worked good service and friendly attitude from the cabin crew made the long flight easier though very happy with the service
  london to delhi this booking was part of a holiday group format so we had to check in as opposed to british-airwaysg drop according to the check in screen all zs were applicable for our destination but we were sent from  z to the next; which given the size of the t5 check in hall was not helpful eventually we managed to find assistance but it was very much a shrug of the shoulder attitude  not especially when we discovered we were seated separately; it was only when a family with two young children had been split up that we were able to switch seats fortunately the cabin crew made up for this by providing a fabulous flight with great service and positive friendly attitude i actually praised them and told them that my faith in ba had been restored
 paris to london flight cancelled due to “atc restrictions” after storm ciara  and rebooked to a later flight which was delayed on top by 2 hours arrived in london 6 hours later than planned initially and ba refused to recognise any additional expenses because it was a forceful operational reason booked 3 flights to italy for march all cancelled last thursday booked lgw/bgy/lgw and next day cancelled for last week of march a month away been a gold member of ba since 2016 and after seeing their constant downgrades i will go british-airwaysck with airfrance/klm for my travel needs ai found thr food and seats on euro business a shame
  i flew from sydney to london to visit my seriously ill mother the second leg from singapore to london was with british-airways my return flight from london to sydney was with british-airways leaving 23 february on 20 february it became clear that mum did not have long to live i contacted ba who said i should be able to change my return date and asked me to send medical documentation which i did with an explanatory email sadly mum passed away very early on the morning of 22 february i contacted ba again the next day they said because i had booked through webjet i needed to contact them i phd them they said they  contact ba no follow up from either when i phd webjet again they said still no word from ba when i phd ba again they said they could not help at this point i gave up and booked with qantas paying for another flight ba's complete lack of compassion apart from a couple of platitudes and lack of interest in helping me in any way astounded me needless to say i will never use british-airways again
  gatwick to malaga nothing special nowadays there's unfortunately not much difference between ba & easyjet flight left gatwick late & arrived in malaga late ba seats no longer recline food and drinks are expensive their cream tea excludes tea lift your game ba your product just continues to  worse
  vancouver to london there are time when british-airways deserve to be ranked as  of the very best carriers this flight proves the point from the warm welcome at the door on boarding until deplaning at lhr the crew were outstanding friendly attentive and professional the dinner was excellent excellent choices on the menu accompanied by some decent wines i had a painful british-airwaysck from running a flight attendant provided some medication came british-airwaysck to my seat an hour or so later to check on me and remembered to ask me if the pain had subsided when i deplaned very thoughtful seat was comfortable and complemented by a proper cushion and a very nice quilted blanket ife good the b747 not400 is showing its age but its still a wonderful iconic aircraft to fly on and ill continue to prefer it over the b777 
  i am flying london to seattle in business class in may 2020 and british-airways wants around £100 each way for me to choose seats all other airlines i have encountered allow business class passengers to choose seats at no additional cost they decided to change my seat for operational reasonss what could that reason be the plane is the same so ba takes £100 off me for me so that i can choose my seat and then changes my seat  not without asking me what i  is an automated message the next time i log on to the ba website to tell me there is a number i can ring 40 minutes waiting for the ph to be answered and i give up 
  london heathrow to nairobi ba first is so much weaker than that of middle eastern and asian airlines i despair the brightest spot of this trip was being able to use the cx lounge at heathrow t3 to cram 14 first notclass seats onto a 777 is quite an achievement but it is the food that is the standout problem on board it is poor and it is shameful that our flag notcarrier represents britain so british-airwaysdly in this regards conversely the flight attendants were excellent in both directions i only flew first because ba's business class is so poor but never again
  dubritish-airwaysi to london my husbritish-airwaysnd and i traveled toher he got business class my ticket was a last minute add noton so was premium economy instead after we boarded my husbritish-airwaysnd came to me to give me his pillow so i got settled and started sleeping i was woken up by a flight attendant who grabbed the pillow that my husbritish-airwaysnd gave me and saying that there is a lady in business class is missing a pillow did i take the pillow i told her i didnt and the pillow was given to me i stood up and told her it wasnt ok for her to accuse me of stealing a pillow and ill show her whom my husbritish-airwaysnd is who gave me the pillow i located my husbritish-airwaysnd in the business class apparently his seat had 1 extra pillow and so he gave me the extra  he offered to give his pillow to the flight attendant who said there was no need and he could keep it

  las vegas to paris via london the staff were great but the 747 was the most uncomfortable flight in business class ive experienced  the aisle seat felt like i was sitting in the aisle a business class configuration of 2 not4 not2 thats a tight squeeze andthere were british-airwaysckward facing seats the seats were not only uncomfortable but just so many things wrong with the configuration i was just glad i didnt pay full price for this flight
  ba cancelled my return flight on 09 notfeb not20 from geneva to gatwick due to storm ciara they rebooked me onto a later flight then cancelled that as well since then i heard nothing more and i was left on my own to buy a new return flight i've tried calling them several times every day but they are not answering their phs claiming they are too busy to talk to customers they cancelled my flight so i want a refund but so far there is no way of ting through to them 
  mexico city to manchester via london my plane from mexico city to london was smooth entertainment was quite nice and so was the food; although i chose a window seat and was never informed it was not actually the window but a wall the crew was amazingly kind and lovely they're always checking on you and we even got a magnum loved this airline for my first flight ever
 london heathrow to sofia a good experience onboard  of bas recently refreshed a321 cabins although unfortunately without any in notseat power supply contrary to what is stated on their website about which aircraft types were due to  in notseat power following refresh another thing to add to the list of inconsistencies with the ba product however the flight overall was very good as usual an extremely efficient pre notflight experience at heathrow's excellent t5 fast track security was fast as expected galleries club lounge was pretty good and not too crowded boarding was smooth with priority boarding honoured as usual the crew were excellent and provided a very attentive service with plently of drinks runs given the slightly longer distance of the flight the food pretty good for a shorthaul business class offering i found the seats to be pretty comfortable and legroom reasonable for a 5 ft 11 chap so overall a good experience with no major complaints
  i was to fly to melbourne from manchester via london and singapore in july 2019 arriving late to board my heathrow flight the check notin notstaff discussed my dilemma with her supervisor only option being to find my way to heathrow i somehow managed to  to heathrow in time where only the singapore to melbourne boarding pass was issued i was told that because manchester to heathrow flight was missed my heathrow to singapore was cancelled 
  madrid to london i keep giving ba the benefit of the doubt but things are ting worse not better this a321 has cramped business class seats no middle table any more and frankly this is a pathetic premium cabin despite every statement they make about catering improvements i simply refer to meal photos on this route in 2016 or 2017 to see they have severely cut british-airwaysck on meal portions and cost iberia staff in  madrid were all very nice cabin staff okay but overall club europe is not worth the my  not do not waste your my on this  
  prague to london this is the first time i have flown with british-airways the flight departed earlier than intended and got to heathrow about 5 minutes early however at heathrow there was a plane in the way as we had arrived early a negative was at the check notin partly the websites fault as we had d the online check in we selected the amount of british-airwaysgs we each had it said we  have to pay extra and we spent forever at the checkin because we had to pay £65 for each british-airwaysg apart from those negatives and the delay i  definitely fly this airline again
  johannesburg to london whoever designed the refurbished galleries lounge at jnb has no understanding of acoustics as every syllable of a facetime conversation was audible 20 feet away add in different languages and some degree of inebriation as you have a recipe for an unrelaxing experience thankfully the upper deck of the a380 was more civilised with an efficient if slightly distant cabin crew who ensured that every was fed and watered by 2 hours after takeoff allowing plenty of time for sleep food was mediocre and i've given up expecting anything more from ba's business class product the white company bedding is more of a gimmick than a genuine enhancement and breakfast has become rather perfunctory with no pastries or bread apart from a solitary croissant arrival at a chilly lhr was ahead of schedule and we were curbside 30 minutes after landing reliability is currently ba's strongest card
  las vegas to gatwick a very disappointing service for club world it felt like i was travelling in economy with attitude especially considering the very high cost of the flight i've paid half as much less for business class returns to australia we got off to a british-airwaysd start when offered  third of a glass of champagne about 2 cm in the bottom of the glass my initial drink after take off was not what i ordered when i queried it i got a lecture on this was how it should be no wine arrived with dinner until i asked for it a second time out of stock of the first choice no second glass of wine offered yes i could have used the call button but 1/3 of a glass of champagne and  glass of wine being offered on a 10 hour business class flight other than the initial bottle of water and a glass of water with dinner no other water was offered until i got up and went to the galley to ask the good news is the food was good and well presented although the promised on the menu selection of pastries with breakfast were not served i later walked past the galley to see the crew eating them for their own breakfast we had dutifully filled in the pre notorder card for breakfast only to find we were being asked again at breakfast sleeping was impossible due to the temperature being so high i actually thought i had a fever i was so drenched in sweat until i spoke to a colleague who was the same i'm used to flying ultra long haul with middle eastern airlines so i'm used to hot cabins but this was crazy only when the crew dropped the temperature a few hours before landing presumably to wake us up was it bearable enough to sleep combined with the a very dry cabin air it was very unpleasant no need to say anything much about the eight across seating as i know the seats are being upgraded over the next few years other than they are very cramped if sitting next to a window i do like the semi notreclined position for take off and landing though i have fairly big shoulders and found the seat width very restrictive there is nowhere to put your spectacles or bottles of water if lying down being on the second aisle we had to join in with the economy passengers queuing to disembritish-airwaysrk so it was not quick at no point did any member of the cabin crew introduce themselves other than via a general pa announcement the seats i can forgive as they are being addressed but the service was bud airline level really ba you need to do much much better the ground staff in las vegas were fast friendly and efficient the lounge was something from the dark ages all 1970's wooden panels
  san diego to stockholm via london had i written this review immediately on landing it  have been zero out of ten but i realise this  be unfair not ba is a game of two halves the inflight experience is immeasurably improved from a few years ago the food in club is excellent the cabin crew attentive and professional the pilots are the best in the industry and ife absolutely fine the club world product is competitive with the better european airlines such as lufthansa and streets ahead of most us carriers the problems start when anything goes wrong  not which it frequently does given the mostly old fleet especially on non notcore routes in my case the flight was cancelled due to the inbound aircraft an ancient 747 going technical then a comedy of errors first the hotel vouchers just said ‘holiday inn there are about 15 in san diego not cue hordes of passengers looking for shuttle buses in the wrong place arriving at hotels with no booking etc etc next the replacement flights the clunky app kept just saying error for some reason eventually the full website on a pc showed my replacement flights but no booking refs or any statement if these were being offered to me were confirmed or whatever on calling ba they nt talk to me because i ‘failed security not i didnt know the billing address of the specific booking which was d by my companys travel department despite having a full executive club account that was associated with the booking and which they could have used the next day i went to take the replacement flights not alaska airlines to newark then sas to stockholm despite ting a boarding card and making it to my seat on the plane i was pulled off minutes before takeoff ba had not paid for the flight a reservation had been created but no ticket issued ba then booked me on a roundabout route british-airwaysck via chicago plus a 12 hour layover from 4am to 4pm ting me home over 36 hours after my original reservation later i spotted that the next ba flight which   me home much sor now had tickets available online why was i not on this when i called they had no explanation and only agreed to ‘exceptionally change my flight again after i complained about all of the above finally i arrived home after a 24 hour delay and a roller coaster of incompetence in summary when all goes well ba is better than it was and staff are doing a heroic inflight job but old planes rubbish british-airwaysck office it infrastructure and plain incompetence mean this airline can be hell if anything goes wrong and bear in mind i was travelling in business class not who knows how they treat economy passengers
  cape town to johannesburg the slow lounge at cape town continues to impress by the standard of service and the generous array of food and drink including ingenious wine notdispensing machines boarding was quick and take notoff was exactly on time there was some turbulence but the captain kept passengers well informed the club meal was the usual offering with the hot options displayed on a tray arrival was 20 minutes ahead of schedule
 on 4th of december before my flight's departure i got my purse stolen in nyc with all my my and my passport in it thanks to the kind strangers i managed to  to the danish embritish-airwaysssy and  a temporary passport when i arrived at the jfk airport it was too late and i was not allowed to drop off my luggage with tears in my eyes i went to the desk where they sell tickets and the employee was so kind and helpful  not she booked me on to the next flight for free got me through security without having to wait in the line and she informed the flight crew what happened when i finally sat down the flight crew were so kind and gave me water and food as i have not had any food for the whole day as i did not have any my i want to say thank you for your service and kindness and for making sure that i got british-airwaysck to denmark safely i was overwhelmed with all the kindness from all the staff once again thank you
  phoenix to london since moving to the usa i've been flying ba more than in the past and overall they provide a more than acceptable service if you choose your seat in club world carefully and the crew are in the right mood then they surpass expectations the new menus and service offering are significantly better than in the past and the wine list more interesting on this flight the crew were engaging and the food was good departed phx early and arrived into lhr early where immigration and british-airwaysggage took minutes if you manage your expectations with ba then you wo not be disappointed with club world
 london heathrow to bangkok d this route a few times with british-airways over the years first time and probritish-airwaysbly last in economy old plane needs upgrade poor entertainment system uncomfortable seats especially for 10+ hour flight i know theyre starting to upgrade these planes but still a long time away the only saving grace was a superb cabin staff in economy
  mumbritish-airwaysi to boston via london my flight with british airways was really good the catering was excellent on both flights and even the service was good however some of the seats have very limited legroom due to the ife box blocking space in front of you also ba had misplaced my tennis racket which was checked in they have a really weird policy that you ca not carry your single sports equipment as cabin british-airwaysggage and instead you have to check it in the ground staff was rude at logan airport in boston also they took a week to deliver my racket to my house even though it arrived in boston 24 hrs after i had come even after contacting ba's baggage customer service they were speaking rudely to me they always tried to cut my call in like 2 minutes without even listening to my concern british-airways needs to improve their ground experience 
 i purchased roundtrip tickets for my wife and i to travel from orlando florida to accra ghana and i purchased advance seat assignments unfortunately british-airways only gave me the seats i paid for for  of four international legs our our roundtrip i have been fighting with british-airways to  my refund for these seat assignments they have only provided me with refund of $234 despite several ph calls and filing multiple on notline calls and providing them with detailed my fightcontinues their customer service is really poor i will never purchase advance seat assignments with them again
  toronto to geneva via london i stopped flying ba about three years ago after they dramatically downgraded their service apparently things have improved somewhat since so i decided to give them another try overall i was happy with my experience save for two major gripes on the plus side: i flew on new aircraft which were comfortable albeit with the usual narrow seats for modern aircraft same with all airlines legroom on the 787 not9 was generous and seemed to be more than the official 31 pilots were very good and informative as always with ba quality of food on long nothaul has definitely improved since the british-airwaysd old days of soggy pasta and droopy sandwiches; i rather enjoyed the meals served which were on nice large trays the ife was just about adequate though surprisingly dated for such new aircraft cathay pacific's is far superior the two major downsides: 1 the new basic economy fare it is really pesky and serves only to disgruntle passengers ba really need to  rid of it virtually every on long nothaul has to check in a british-airwaysg so please just include it in all airfare types if i wanted to be nickle notand notdimed i'd fly to gatwick on a charter airline also not being able to choose a seat even at the time of check notin is infuriating i was automatically allocated a middle seat even though the entire rear half of the plane was empty this just goes to show that you will  a middle seat unless you pay thankfully the lady at check notin changed it to a window seat free of charge after i asked nicely 2 no complimentary catering on short nothaul seeing as virtually all passengers flying to/from heathrow are connecting to/from long nothaul flights with ba and have spent at least $1000 on their airfare i resented a drink and snack not being included on the short nothaul segment of my trip ba should not be treating connecting passengers the same as those on low notcost airlines who only paid a few dollars for a short trip if ba   rid of these two new features i  not hesitate to fly with them again as everything else about my trip was pleasant as it is i  still consider other airlines
 hong kong to london heathrow with british-airways one of the best flights ive had in a premium cabin the service seat food and wine are among the best ive experienced the only gripe i had was the cabin temperature which was quite warm and sleeping was quite impossible at first even with pyjamas on provided by ba the cabin attendant did my own bed and it was a nice touch i  not hesitate flying first class with ba on my next flight
  san jose to amsterdam via london layout of boeing 787 cabin is poor with rearmost seat not having luggage bins row 42 not44 d e and f in addition the crew fill the bins over the outer seats row 42 not43 k j with their british-airwaysgs and blankets i  not recommend ba or the 787
  singapore to paris via london the flight was a ok dated seating with shakey arms not the most comfortable but a serviceable experience however our luggage was not loaded onto the flight the second time this happened now with ba and despite a 13 hour flight 2 hour stopover and 1 hour flight to paris ba did not make any effort to inform us at any time of the issue instead after travelling for around 17 hours we had to wait for the british-airwaysggage to all come and clear before we realised ours was missing being a sunday and most shops close at lunchtime that also left little time to buy emergency items and the despite knowing they hadnt loaded the british-airwaysggage they could not find a way to send it quicker than 24 hours after arrival meaning 2 out of 3 days in paris will be spent without luggage
  warsaw to london everything went like clockwork and nothing could be disliked about this flight professional crew with beams on their faces new aircraft it's important to choose a seat no further than row 14 in a321neo as those seats are the old type pinnacle seats and have better legroom very informative captain who told us about expected turbulence before we had taken off very much appreciated on time landing and good atmosphere on board the food in euro traveller is unfortunately no longer free however being in ba's executive club you can pay for the food & drinks with avios which is very convenient the only drawbritish-airwaysck i could find is a long queue to the british-airwaysg check notin at warsaw airport  not 3 opened check notin counters for approx 200 people is rather not enough
  new york  to london heathrow very good staff very nice comfortable seats seat recline good enough food a bit limited i  recommend ba to others since they are a very good airline
  london to los angeles take off was delayed by 3 hrs which we spent onboard because of a dent to the door which needed inspection  not sure maybe outside of their control i was flying with my wife and two kids 2 & 4 sitting on bulkhead with 3 seats and using the british-airwaysby british-airwaysssinet facility after take off we saw that the inflight entertainment service for the whole section  not not whole cabin was not working and we were sitting into an 115hr overnight flight with two little s meaning sleeping was not going to happen we contacted the cabin crew who made zero accommodation sorry they said during the flight the cabin crew stood in the galley behind the bulkhead talking loudly while the lights were dimmed and kept slamming drawers as they moved things around to cap it off we landed at 10pm et and they had left behind our british-airwaysby car seat and stroller we finally received them british-airwaysck 2 days later conclusion never fly ba again
  british-airways comair johannesburg to cape town route is never less than fully subscribed and on this occasion the equivalent of club europe stretched british-airwaysck 9 rows service followed the usual pattern of a drink champagne included and comairs idiosyncratic ‘four notcourse meal ie a tiny salad a hot course that  could see before choosing a minute iced cake and a minuscule cheese & biscuits the hot meal is invariably scorched around the edges comair really need to move with the times to a more modern business class offering aside from the meal the flight was typically efficient with arrival slightly ahead of schedule
  london to bangkok it's not what it used to be but most importantly it does not deliver what it promises any longer  disappointing food outdated and uncomfortable seats appalling british-airwaysggage handling at lhr and  mediocre crew service onboard the customer service online is just as british-airwaysd my most recent experience was early january 2020 when they put me next to a couple with a newborn british-airwaysby in club world on an overnight flight from lhr to bkk baby screams could not sleep and as the cabin was full they could not move me the couple was very nice apoloic and we just had to bear the 12 hours long haul flight toher however my dealings with customer service was appalling when is ba going to offer a kids free z in club world for people who need to work or sleep
  london to johannesburg departure was slightly delayed by 50 mph gusts but once away  the flight was the usual comfortable experience on the upper deck seats 53j/k are some of the best as long as the galley is quiet the dinner service was efficient and we were ready for sleep after a film cabin crew were pleasant and attentive toilets were kept clean throughout the flight arrival was 30 minutes behind time but british-airwaysggage collection and customs were mercifully quick so we were in the slow lounge just 40 minutes after landing overall a good flight
  overall a very comfortable flight with british-airways both of my flights took off on time and reached on time i was really excited to fly ba since they changed the aircraft from boeing 777 not200 to a boeing 747 not400 which is known as the queen of the skies  the flight attendants are very nice and professional towards passengers they did their best to speed up the boarding process since both of my flights were full and we took off everything went well on my first flight and also flight time went short over the atlantic due to great tail winds on my second flight to mumbritish-airwaysi the flight attendants were polite and respectful and gave the best service however during the lunch service they ran out of vearian food option and had to fetch for vearian food in other cabins and even give crew meals to passengers who were vearian overall my both flights with ba were good there are some shortcomings on their older fleet like lack of usb ports power outlet old ife the ife box in front of you that blocks your legroom  ba  need to refurbish their old cabins on boeing 777 not200 and boeing 747if they still plan to use them on longer flights
  los angeles to london on 6th january and my husbritish-airwaysnds seat was broken the customer service manager was rude to me and made insinuations about our intentions it was a dreadful way to end our hymoon and left a bitter taste a truly horrendous experience
  gatwick to cancun flight was late my food was british-airwaysd and it was not possible to change i paid for the internet which did not work for me most of the time was advised to report but no instructions to where or how
" 
fantastic flight travelled solo from london gatwick to glasgow in british-airways club europe cabin and could not fault  aspect of the service i arrived at gatwick around 2 hours prior to departure all ba club world passengers are entitled to fast track security at gatwick this was quick and the staff were pleasant enough the lounge at gatwick was clean and modern and made for a nice relaxing start to the journey boarding was quick and the flight departed on nottime and landed 10 minutes early the crew were very attentive and friendly the in notflight meal was delicious i had smoked salmon served with curried rice overall a really lovely flying experience had there been ever notso notslightly more leg room and in notflight entertainment id have given this flight 10/10 a fantastic crew who were a credit to the airline"
  rio de janeiro to london heathrow love this aircraft only a 3 class business world traveller plus and economy class 2 cabins in business class front 3 rows and rear 2 rows i had seat 3a in my opinion the seat window seat with a bit more space than the usual seat at 6'4'' a little extra helps very private tucked behind second galley area toilet is over the other side j/k i settled in to sleep and did not have an evening meal crew very accommodating as they offered water bottles immediately a good few hours sleep as normal and woke up about 10 minutes before breakfast i really enjoyed the fruit yoghurt muesli and the full english breakfast all in all great service good flight and felt fully relaxed
  gatwick to tirana i was incredibly disappointed by the service provided on this flight because it was virtually impossible for me to differentiate what made this flight different from being in economy business class passengers boarded at the same time as economy class passengers there was no curtain dividing economy class from business class and the people in economy class had taken the liberty of removing my cabin british-airwaysg from my space above my seat to three seats behind me  the seats were the same seats you have in economy the difference being that the middle seat is empty thus creating a divide between window and aisle seats  i encountered odd problems with the meal as well  not the lovely cabin crew member notified me that i had no other choice but to eat pasta for dinner because other choices had finished you are better off in economy as you pay less and  the same service flight left on time and landed early british-airways have in my opinion the  best inflight w notfi service for 10 pounds you  unlimited very high speed wi notfi where you can stream youtube videos they offer cheaper packages as well where you can  unlimited texts
 keflavik to london heathrow cabin crew were amazing weather was terrifying as we drove to the airport so we knew things were going to be tough expecting a delay and seeing other european flights were cancelled we expected the same but then were surprised to see our flight boarding snow in blizzard conditions we were surprised but got settled in our seats crew very friendly and a long story short after 3 hours on the ground waiting for the di noticing machine we finally made our way to take off all the staff were so relaxed and calm with all passengers including those who had connecting flights they sat with each  and personally looked at their options the ba online app to help them non notalcoholic drinks and snacks were provided during this time the first officer kept us informed all the time that is was not ba fault that the de noticing machine was delayed so much eventually procedures d we were ready for take notoff how the pilot and team managed this in these conditions i will never now but it was a smooth take off an when through the clouds a smooth journey all the way british-airwaysck to heathrow cabin crew provided excellent service being business we were lucky to have champagne and our meals were excellent veg shepherds pie and chicken curry both lovely so just want to thank you ba we know you  a lot of negative reviews but this is to say we ca not fault you particularly the crew who made a real effort to talk to all of us well d
  fly economy and youll be paying more for an awful service the london to vancouver route uses old planes the oldest inflight entertainment systems and my food was inedible 
 my partner and i spent christmas in tokyo the flight over was enjoyable the staff were polite and helpful and it all ran smoothly our experience british-airwaysck home was completely different the staff were incredibly rude and lazy the flight was 12 hours and mid flight my partner asked for a bottle of water the lady very rudely said she was going the other way and that my partner could head to the british-airwaysck and help herself my partner headed to the british-airwaysck where there were two more ladies sitting and when requested they pointed to a shelf my partner got the water from both our tv's stopped working mid flight also for a period of 40 minutes we asked the staff if they could fix the problem the lady said she  try while sighing as 25 year olds deciding on which airline brands to remain loyal to i can tell you british-airways will not be it terrible customer service
  london to hong kong at the entrance to the ba business lounge there was a sign saying silver and gold members only my membership had just dropped to bronze while my wife's remained at silver at the reception desk i asked why bronze was not allowed and was only told i could enter as a guest of my wife's when i got to the entrance we showed our boarding passes and i can only assume the lady must have overheard our previous conversation as my wife was asked if she was bringing me in as her guest no warm greeting just a job's worth high handed attitude neither of the ba reps bothered to check my boarding pass properly had they d so they  have seen that it was a business class ticket and i had the right to enter under my own steam anyway fortunately the cabin staff were friendly and much nicer
  los angeles to london heathrow if i could give ba a zero stars i  they have the worst customer service ive flown many airlines around the world with my family but surely we will never fly with british-airways again they gave our seats away on the return flight and  not address this after purchasing expensive business class tickets 45 months in advance to ensure that our family flew 12 hour flight toher the flight to london didnt have the best service most toilets were out of service the beds in business class are the most uncomfortable of all business class ive flown the check notin process at heathrow was disastrous the most inefficient process with no human assistances the limited s available were all slammed with line of customers i  highly suggest you refrain from using this carrier i wish i  have d a bit of research prior to flying with them
  istanbul to london we had to wait for ages to check into our flight after being advised to turn up 3 hrs before departure time to check in we had to wait for 40 minutes before any check in staff turned up once they did the staff were surly and rude on the flight and there was no ife no free drink or snack or  a map to track the flight the onboard crew were a bit chaotic serving m&s food for purchase the flight was not delayed by too much and relatively smooth however the ba product is now tired and slightly pathetic 
  london to bucharest on my flight the hot food finished half way through  not i was seated on row 22 and by the time the food cart reached my row there were no sandwiches left to purchase the fitting of the cabin was horrendous seat change from  row to the other 24h before take off cost me an additional 13 gbp 
  london heathrow to rio de janeiro not the usual aircraft for this route but it is  of my favourites this aircraft today has a first class but was flown empty as it usually only offers club world flight not full seated in 7f aisle seat no  in the middle seat so very pleasant it is away from the toilet over at 7a/b but next to galley area which was great as it is a day flight food pre notordered was very good as usual plenty of drinks offered crew very keen to assist again nothing any trouble at all i did watch some films but i had already been on a previous ba long haul so was not really looking for much i had some rest as it was a long day and i ting a cold arrived late due to a technical problem at heathrow they managed to fix the problem on the taxiway to the runway but after an hour i must say i did not really need to be told they were trying to fix the problem rather than return to the departure gate all in all another very good flight
  london to athens the aircraft and the flight quality were good but they do not provide free food and drink it was unacceptable they did not have sufficient supply for goods they were selling so it ended quickly
  copenhagen to london super slow had to wait for buses which were delayed also packed the buses to tight with people where too far from arrival terminals service british-airwaysd from staff coming to terminal 5 is the worst terminal on heathrow the food and beverage on board was terrible for the price for the price of the airline ticket the whole experience was way below expected service and time of staff

  i recently flew from cape town in south africa via london to brussels it was our anniversary and we were treated to a glass of bubbly after take off the staff were so friendly and i cannot even complain about the food served on board which i might add i seldom enjoy food served on flights
  sydney to toulouse via singapore / london boeing 777 and ife ancient the comfort and service superb highlight on the tls notlhr sector a £550 celebratory treat with mince pie christmas cake brandy butter which combined with a g&t hit the spot you could argue it should be free but im not complaining  i do miss the ba quality of service but compared to the me airlines youre still pretty good
  sofia to london a good overall experience departure experience let down by poor airport lounge in sofia and complete failure to honour priority boarding flight experience generally good and arrival experience at heathrow very good and efficient

  hong kong to london i booked a return ticket for my sister though ba provided travel document details they required however when we got to the airport we found out my sisters middle name was not on her ticket and it therefore did not match her passport name they refused to let her fly after much hassle and my sister ting a temporary visa they enable her to fly however once landing in london i acknowledged that she may have the same problem flying british-airwaysck to taiwan igot in contact with bas' executive ph helpline service yet spending a day speaking to them they have only caused me to speak to numerous different people all telling me to do different things we have still not resolved the issue of her ticket not having her middle name on ba are refusing to alter the ticket information to add my sisters middle name onto the ticket they have not been helpful on the ph when i asked them to add her middle name and are not interested in try to solve the issue at hand they were insistent on speaking to my sister who is from taiwan and i told them she is unable to speak english and that i can translate any question for her they did not allow this so she was put on the ph however they only spoke english to her
  my husbritish-airwaysnd and i used british-airways to fly from london to paris this past august when we arrived at airport we needed to pay for british-airwaysgs was charged 4 times for  british-airwaysg after i was assured charges did not go through have been trying to  a refund from ba since they give you a ph number to call for these claims only to never answer the ph they have you do a claim online only to never respond to your emails i sent them the british-airwaysnk statements and credit card statement showing that i had been charged 4 times for  british-airwaysg only 2 months later did they finally respond to the claim claiming i had two british-airwaysgs and despite the fact that i sent documentation showing 4 charges and confirmed with british-airwaysnk and credit card that the charges had g through they only saw two charges and since i had two british-airwaysgs they did not owe me any my they force you to communicate via email and then do not respond they owe me $258 usd and refuse to give me my my at this point 
  new york to london i was on the last flight out at 1135 pm and this is clearly the cheaper version in all respects  the boeing 777 certainly showed its age ife screen was tiny seat was well used the flight time was quick 550 hours and thats about it fa is highly professional to the point of being unfriendly to me the f& b was standard and not taken as i had eaten something earlier i'm a one world emerald and the cabin manager did not greet me its a small touch and in the grand scheme of things means little but is an acknowledgement that you spend time and my with that carrier usually followed by a drink or two 
  austin to london along with an $1900 purchase price for each of two roundtrip tickets for my wife and daughter ba charged an additional $250 for seat reservations to ensure they sat toher when they went to check in those seat reservations in both directions had been given away and family had to sit in different seats back home i applied for a refund of the $250 seat fee and was told there was no proof i paid for them i have credit card charges and email confirmations clearly stating these charges were made but there is no process to upload those documents to ba
  frankfurt to london with british-airways awful airline put me and my wife at opposite ends of the plane even though we booked toher gave me middle seat even though many others were free a childish airline which charges a premium and then goes out to make the journey difficult for you if you do not book biz class avoid
  london to glasgow with british-airways flight is again delayed its not like its a  off as its delayed every week like a british-airwaysd joke really a poor yet very expensive airline who i nt recommend to any traveller
 london to san francisco this flight was a delight friendly relaxed crew good food and wine and a main deck club world cabin that was nearly empty if you manage your expectations with ba club world and everything goes as it should then you should not be disappointed yes the rollout of the new club world suite has been a long time coming however the food service has improved considerably  not ba are trying valiantly to regain their long g moniker of world's favourite airline the 747 has seen better days however given they're being removed from most airline's passenger services you should take the opportunity to fly  before they're g i'm gradually regaining my confidence in ba
  heathrow to belfast great service in belfast but absolutely shocking in t5 at heathrow very rude check in staff when told we had to print out boarding passes and also for our suitcases totally disgusted cabin crew were lovely on the 1240 flight to belfast on 9th december
  london to singapore i was apprehensive about flying ba club world after reading many negative reviews i was however surprised firstly they are not on part with sq or qr  not but to be fair i found them to be  of the most reasonably priced offerings you  what you pay for the seat while old is perfectly comfortable with plenty of space the window seats are best for privacy i am tall and had no issues sleeping in fact i slept for almost 7 hours the service and food out of london was top notch fresh and plentiful which is a welcome contrast to the tiny meals you receive on qantas service was consistent polite and very attentive drinks and water continually topped up i was truly impressed the return flight's service was very average and quite sloppy but lets focus on the positives
 toulouse to london i'm a able bodied fit ba customer and silver member and was seated at an emergency exit seat i'd put away all items and had fastened my seatbelt in full compliance of regultions a cabin crew member came to my row to point out the security exit and safety card and i was listening to him and responding despite this he ordered me to take out my cabin pressure equalizers which he called earplugs i explained to him that i needed to keep them on to protect my ears as the doors were already closed and i can suffer from ear problems when i fly i told him i could hear him perfectly as demonstrated by our vocal exchange despite this he kept talking over me and threatened to remove me from my seat should i fail to follow his order after i begrudgingly took them off he once again ordered me to do it or be removed from my seat and i pointed out i already had i then asked to speak to the purser who came to see me after take off i told him his cabin crew member was unnecessarily rude and needed customer care training or indeed to look for a new job i wrote in to british-airways with my complaint but they have not even bothered to respond awful rude airline
  london heathrow to stockholm business class short nothaul is what it is seats are the same as in economy but with no  sitting in the middle seat but you  served drinks and food proper gin for the g&t and good food
  johannesburg to london we had limited recline seats on an 11 hour overnight flight at checked in we asked and were told we had good seats completed a complaint and asked why ba thought this was ok how come their representatives are allowed to lie never flying ba again
  johannesburg to london the recently refurbished first and club world lounge at jnb has failed to resolve the congestion when passengers from the two evening flights to lhr descend on it there's more table space for eating and the food has improved but poor acoustics mean intrusion on privacy crying british-airwaysbies and facetime calls add to the restless maelstrom of human activity boarding was reasonably quick although there was the usual confusion about group queues the predominantly young mixed fleet crew were competent but lacked finesse and kept on ting drinks orders muddled the meal service took ages because of some unidentified problem with heating the main course the food itself was not at all british-airwaysd  not when it was finally served the cabin temperature was not too hot and we both slept quite well arrival was ten minutes ahead of schedule and british-airwaysggage collection was quick overall a good flight despite the aged club world product
  london heathrow to miami flying the boeing 747 not400 unfortunately ba has not d much work on their first class on these aircraft seats are flat bed but you have that wedge in the front that even for my 6'1 makes the beds small and since it's so narrow your feet  clamped if you sleep on your side these seats are business class on for example qatar airways and i still think a first class ticket should include wifi but as always the service excel and the crew are so friendly and helpful meals are impeccable
  stockholm to london heathrow as always ba works excellent with service on the ground and in the air they still have a good gin aboard for a decent g&t and even if the meals in business looks like the came from the 90's economy they taste great
 london to sydney via singapore flight left on time cabin crew where fantastic meals were great leaving london we had a chicken stir fry and landing into singapore at 18:00 we were served an english breakfast which i can eat any time of day but wife thought it was a bit odd at singapore all passengers had to disembritish-airwaysrk the aircraft while it was refuelled and clean when re notboarding you had to go through a security check at the gate we were on the ground in singapore for 1hour 30min 2nd leg to sydney was great also food and drink service was great again 23 hours long haul flight was comfortable we had exit row seating for entire flight which i recommend to any over 6ft tall
 london to new york jfk we were booked on brussels airlines two of us which cancelled the flight and rerouted us on ba the flight bru to london was fine but the transatlantic leg and heathrow airport terminal 5 were utter nightmares never again will i go to or through heathrow however this review is about ba's 747 not400 to jfk an aircraft that was in such a sorry state that it should have been junked years ago how does ba have the gall to call its service business class the seats were tiny and wrapped in plastic chicken coop partitions that rattled and even fell down on several occasions let me add that we faced british-airwaysckwards and looked at a filthy wall cabin service was friendly and the food was actually quite decent aside from that i now understand why ba has such a horrendous and well notdeserved reputation never again
  the first thing is the shortage of staff the business cabin is quite large and eight across and seem to be serviced by  or two people each side it meant that the drink after takeoff did not appear for an hour after the order was taken unfortunately although they were pleasant the staff were not up to the mark and appeared very undertrained i asked a young man to turn on the reading light and he claimed there were not any i showed him the  by my seat and after fiddling with it he said it must be broken at the end of the flight i discovered the switch despite being a newly configured plane the dividing screen kept dropping i had to ask for a cup of tea 3 times there was only a choice of two reds and two white wines and considering the number of people in the business section i cannot understand why they   not offer a third there was port on the menu but was never offered with cheese every time the next course came out the setting was not ready to accept it due to plates and glasses from previous course many people had clutter uncleared for an hour after end of meal most of the courses were quite small portions and by the end of the meal i was ready for a mini snack i am not a big eater but i was peckish the layout of the business cabin is cramped i am 6' and i could not stretch out the seats and legroom are extremely narrow and people in the centre two rows and the window seats have to climb over other passengers this means no  has a easy seat you either have to climb or be climbed over i wonder how they can expect such a british-airwaysd design to be accepted in the business market i travel on many airlines in business and ba is still the bottom of the pile and reluctantly the last  i  use the centre and window seats have their food and drinks served effectively through the service hatch across other customers unfortunately upon arrival at bridown the ba team did not  any better after  hour 25 minutes of waiting for my fast tracked luggage i approached a guy wearing a ba tabritish-airwaysrd and he just shrugged his shoulders i then found another guy who worked for the ground staff and he went outside and found about 25 cases sitting by the tarmac doing nothing 
  brussels to bangkok via london club world from london to bangkok on 17 nov 2019 seats 15c and 15d it was a boeing 777 with a 2 not4 not2 seat configuration in the business cabin which gives the cabin a crowded impression the seats are comfortable with a flat bed +mattress good selection of entertainment although a rather small screen the food menu offers different choices of starters main course and desserts the food was disappointing i had smoked salmon as a starter and british beef as main course my soup was cold mybeef was overcooked and quantity was economy class notlike the service is very friendly but not personal im used to be adressed by my name when i fly business class  while serving the meals they for serving me wine the amount of cabin crew is not enough for a crowded business class cabin after dinner i went to sleep the seat is turned into a real bed with an extra mattress and a good pillow the space is narrow it is difficult to make the bed once the bed is made there is no place to put  personal stuff i had a real good night of sleep though if your seat is not at the aisle you have to step over somes legs to go to the toilet the toilets are small and simple not cleaned frequently enough when i woke up breakfast service was running  the breakfast is good  yoghurt pastries fresh fruit and a full english breakfast overall british-airways world club is a rather standard business class lacks personalized attention and lacks the feel good experience  if ba wants to compete they have a long way to go i hope they can make it up a bit on our return flight
  san francisco to oslo via london the head support was damaged so i had to sit 10 hours leaned forward the flight from san francisco was delayed so i missed my connecting flight in london to oslo i came first to the ba counter but received a new flight 3 hours 15 minutes later rude staff gave me a voucher for 15 gbp 
  i had a connection flight from london to berlin traveling with hand luggage i got through a automatic boarding gate and the man at the gate said that i need to check my british-airwaysggage  he has no right to grab my passport and boarding pass if the flight is full they should check overhead lockers if there arent any things which should be put under seats and where can fits more hand luggage the flight arrived in berlin 7 minutes late
  london to johannesburg with british-airways bas b gates lounge is a rather more civilised place to pass time than the galleries lounges in the main terminal its also a tad closer on the transit  not or via the rather useful walkway on level  not4  not to the c gates where the a380s depart from the new boarding by groups meant snaking queues but at least group 2 moved fairly speedily the club world were still the same much maligned seats with the small unresponsive ife screens and limited selection of films the dinner service was slow because of the unwise introduction of individual trays brought to each seat trolleys may lack glamour but  does  off to sleep quicker on an overnight flight breakfast was adequate but nothing more landing was exactly on time overall a reasonable flight but the inflight service was distinctly average
  london to bangalore the flight from bangalore to london on 10 november 2019 was delayed by 4 hours that resulted in me missing the connection flight my return from london to bangalore was initially delayed by 15 hrs we were assigned a boarding gate and after waiting at the gate for 30 mins announcement was made the flight was delayed 4hrs 27mins due to maintenance 
 london to sydney via singapore i  like to express my thanks and appreciation to the staff at the british-airwaysg drop centre at heathrow when i lost my passport on thursday evening  not21st november they spent nearly 2 hours trying to locate it and it was eventually found 30 mins before my flight was due to leave a big thank you to you all i  also like to thank the cabin crew on flight ba0015 notsingapore to sydney  not22 november who were so kind after i was taken ill during the flight i was looked after so well
  lisbon to london i pay extra to check my british-airwaysg to ensure i am not using more than my share of overhead space to have british-airways charge me 50 euros to check a british-airwaysg to my final destination and then insist that my briefcase be put under the seat in a cramped aircraft to ensure there is room in the overhead bin for travelers too cheap to check their british-airwaysgs is an insult will never fly ba again
  ba operate daily shuttles from london to glasgow its a busy route and i'm sure make my plus there is no competition however ba flights are rarely on time and the fee paying passenger's are fed stories about the aircraft was delayed en notroute from some far flung exotic location because i have several buses and trains to catch after i reach glasgow punctuality means a lot to me and not a lot to ba hence i'm very disappointed with the service they provide
  doha to london surprisingly good flight ontime departure and early arrival by 30min very very attentive and friendly crew especially towards children food was halal since from doha clearly announced to passengers bag arrival was ok seat leg room and entertainment beyond my expectation
  london to buenos aires we paid extra on top of our holiday cost to fly with them as it was a direct flight firstly they cancelled our flight a few months before departure meaning we had to go a day earlier and pay an extra night in a hotel the plane was old and cramped making it difficult to  up and walk around during the 14 hour flight the entertainment system was pathetic not much film choice a random selection of tv programmes and no games the drinks service was lacking my food was awful and there were no snacks offered in between on other long haul flights we have had comfort packs with toothbrush/toothpaste etc no such offerings
  san francisco to london a380 is a wonderful aeroplane movie selection was below average staff were polite fist time i used the call button mid notflight response was fast but on second occasion i was repeatedly ignored call button for 45 minutes i dont see how that is acceptable
 sydney to singapore with british-airways packed in like sardines in a tin can what a disappointment of an airline they pack you in and even ting to your seat is a debritish-airwayscle due to the cramped nature of the flight configuration you awkwardly stare at your fellow guests who sit right opposite you trying not to lock gaze my seat was so close to the aisle that at times it felt like people were walking over me to  past very narrow passage ways would not and could not recommended this airline these seats are at best premium economy
 london to mauritius we are fortunate enough to have flown with many different airlines including low cost carriers and also upper class cabins on other premium airlines without a shadow of a doubt the whole british-airways experience is the poorest of them all both with the aeroplanes and seats the general service and experience but more importantly the poor customer service following the british-airwaysd flight i truly feel that this airline deserves to go bust because of the truly disgraceful approach to service and the product they deliver i begrudge flying with them and given the option i always choose a different airline
  los angeles to amsterdam via london due to delayed take off i risked missing my connecting flight thanks to the excellent premium host service julie and her colleague i managed to be on time thank you very much
  london to vancouver i used to fly this aircraft and route for many years until it was no longer priced competitively i flew on the 14th and it was a remarkably british-airwaysd experience food service was very poor in most aspects i had the chicken tandoori which was far too spicy for most palettes no drink was offered with the meal which was astonishing rather tea and coffee an obviously far cheaper offering was supplied soon after the dinner tray was handed i had to ask twice for a beer before it was deliveredthis then put me out of sync with the service the  time yes  time offer of tea and coffee was then obviously missed by me completely service itself was not good with no warmth or hospitality on a 9hr flight engagement is pretty critical our hostess/host seemed to be only interested in those sitting in the extra legroom seats and essentially ignored every else the cold snack was a cold tasteless sandwich just prior to landing the entertainment system is a joke as it is so old i had become so accustomed to a normal/newish tv screen that i was blown away that this system was still in place the screen size was the equivalent of your phs no music selection worth talking about so i just used my ipad on this or similar routes i have flown air canada westjet virgin atlantic air transat ba was by far the worst and some of those airlines are bud in nature and offer paid meals only i cannot believe that the mighty ba offers such a terrible product in 2019 i will spend more to fly better and actively avoid ba on long haul
 the flight departure was delayed due to what the captain described in his announcement as a mix up with paperwork disembritish-airwaysrkation was delayed due to what he also described as a mix up with landing bridge allocation so the plane had to taxi around the runway until a gate was found we missed our connecting flight the staff in purple at the airport who are supposed to help passengers find connecting flights didnt know what to do we ended up being shunted onto another flight resulting in a four hour delay all of this inconvenience is due to bas incompetent management my seat  not recline and the food was just carbohydrate filigree the flight attendants are rude it used to be a good airline
 london heathrow to lisbon mediocre the flight was very smooth and arrived on time cabin service left a great deal to be desired and staff seemed to be just going through the motions no bread roll was offered during meal service and despite requesting a glass of wine to accompany the meal this was not forthcoming and staff required a ‘nudge before it was delivered not a great club europe experience
 london to boston comfortable flight in economy class food was fairly good both ways  not dinner for the evening flight west and the returning night flight east got some solid sleep in on the flight british-airwaysck
 tirana to london gatwick i fly british-airways around six times a month thanks to my work and while i almost always have a pleasant experience this past flight definitely outdid all the others we boarded and departed exactly on time with a very friendly and welcoming crew while the flight was fully booked my travel companion and i were lucky that no  was sitting on our row so that we could have an empty middle seat and therefore more space the best surprise of this flight by far was the availability of wi notfi which i have never had on any other british-airways flight within europe in fact the wi notfi package i got which included only texting was unlimited and incredibly fast  not as good as my home connection this truly made this flight more enjoyable as it allowed me to continue my business even during the flight which is extremely valuable to me something that british-airways can improve on  be leg space which in this flight i noticed was particularly tight although that is a common problem for me as i am 188 cm tall also for unknown reasons no food or snacks were served on this 2 hours 45 minute flight only drinks this was a slight struggle as i had skipped breakfast but i managed well the flight however arrived ahead of schedule and we de notboarded quickly i always recommend ba  not and will continue to do so
  gatwick to st lucia great service on this flight thank you very much for the cabin and the great cabin crew excellent service
  london to singapore i have to commend ba staff on this occasion they were friendly welcoming and so accommodating to passengers throughout the flight even in the last few moments they were laughing and joking with us highly professional and sensitive to our needs despite their own tiredness thank you ba for making a long journey a tolerable  
  london to san francisco return in economy the seats are small outbound was bearable because there was an empty seat between the two of us but returning no empty seat and it was horrible i'm only 5'5 and female but could not lean down to the seat in front of me to collect my belongings if you want to  anything from your british-airwaysg below the seat in front of you you will need to do some major maneuvering touching the person next to you throughout the flight is unavoidable i flew on a 747 both ways they no longer have any air vents you can adjust so both flights got stuffy and warm i had to ask them to turn up the a/c both ways i was literally sweating economy is small with the aircraft mostly made up of business class asian vearian meal was good as usual although the breakfast was terrible asian vearian breakfast in economy plus is much better i will find an alternative airline for my long haul flights it's not worth it
  gatwick to venice we have flown this route and class on two occasions and been pleased with all aspects on the recent trip we both had mobility issues and the check in operator immediately suggested their assistance service it was welcome and efficient particularly as the gate was a very distant  the flight departed to time the cabin staff were pleasant the food was good in flight information from the flight deck was good the landings were noticeably smooth the return journey was similarly good i was very satisfied
  bordeaux to gatwick british-airways cancelled my september 11 flight due to the pilots strike with advance notice i made alternative travel arrangements confirmed that i wanted to to cancel from my end in order to receive a refund and received confirmation from ba on 24 august 2019 ba refunded my fare soon enough but i am still awaiting a refund for the 70 euro cost of british-airwaysggage that i paid  not six weeks later i lodged a complaint on 9th october no action i lodged another complaint on 25th october and still no action they cancelled my flight and wo not refund my my and they call it customer service 
  seychelles to london day time flight british-airwaysck to london staff were very welcoming greeted on entry to aircraft and shown to seats 7 j/k best seats as a couple to book as they are away from the toilet in the front cabin and the window k seat has direct access to the aisle on nottime departure and swift meal services nothing was any trouble at all and the flight was full easy access to the club kitchen after meal service and great entertainment i have found this flight great and love the inbound day time flight to london the easiest to travel on seat and screens worked great and no problems i loved every minute of the flight a big thank you to all the staff who were fantastic looking forward to my next flight to rio in december
 london to belfast british-airways bullied my parents and spoilt a special occasion i booked my parents on ba to attend my investiture at the palace my mother had a heart attack 3 months ago and this was her first flight post recovery and i had chosen ba expecting the best level of service instead they were treated appallingly and felt bullied by the airline staff my mother suffers from claustrophobia and always requests an aisle seat and i booked my parents on 2 aisle seats side by side i printed their boarding passes out myself with seats 24c and 24d on arrival at check notin  of the boarding passes was not recognised by the scanner so assistance printed out a new  on going through security the boarding pass was again not recognised and a new pass was printed once my parents arrived at the gate they noticed that  of the seats had been changed my father explained the situation but the rep at check notin started quoting the ‘geneva convention that ba are only contracted to  them from a to b and could change seats if they wanted waiting at the gate to try and resolve the situation and eventually with 5 minutes before airborne they were rushed into the aircraft and forced to sit apart with no care for their welfare or circumstances at no stage did they receive any apoloic words for some recovering from a heart attack this was an unnecessary stressful event and spoilt what had been a special family occasion i have been holding on with the hope that bas slide from grace will halt but seem to be constantly disappointed i will await bas response to my parents; i know they will not fly the carrier again but i will be handing british-airwaysck my ba amex and all points if an appropriate apology is not issued will update in summary dont trust ba with your loved s care
  london to cape town we had booked business class tickets a year in advance for a trip to africa i usually fly star alliance but picked ba for a segment for better connection timing through london to cape town this was a huge mistake i had tried to reserve seats on ba website twice and was not able to do so then i tried to call ba twice and gave up after being on hold for an hour each time with no call british-airwaysck option when we arrived today in london from toronto at the connections desk seven hours before our flight we were told that business class was oversold and we  be downgraded to premium economy bas representative told us that because we did not have reserved seats we were at the bottom of the list for business class and that loyalty customers  all have priority for seats over us but we  still be welcome in the lounge as if this was a bonus then there was a problem for us to clear security to  to the lounge since they could not print our boarding passes due to the down grade it took close to an hour to  settled into the lounge from the time we first arrived at the connecting desk we asked to speak to a manager but at each of our four interactions with ba staff we were told that they   some to speak with us giving the impression that they were trying to pass off unhappy customers as fast as they could at  point i got visibly frustrated after the ba staff issuing our new boarding passes indicated that our down grade was voluntary which it definitely was not after two and a half hours ba customer service managers came to speak with us they were the first s who were actually apoloic and tried to address the situation from a customer oriented perspective if british-airways think giving bulkhead seats in premium economy and british-airwayssic lounge access to paying business class passengers is adequate customer service for a downgrade from a paid business fare on our upcoming overnight flight i will not be booking flights on ba again
  san jose to london the tv screen of 12f was broken could not be locked into position that  allow to watch movies flight attendants could not fix it and suggested to move to a different seat which we slipped on purpose while checked in the british-airwaysck of the seat in front was dirty the tray on the 12d where i was moved to had a hole on the right side and the tv screen was not sensitive enough to be be operated by touch although my husbritish-airwaysnd in 12e and me turned in the breakfast cards toher the flight attendant insisted they dont have it and was not planning to wake him up and serve him breakfast  flight attendants were doing their best but it seems that they were understaffed
 london heathrow to edinburgh boarding efficient flight was full so passengers asked to volunteer to check in hand luggage by doing so they   priority boarding i took up the offer too out my laptop and carried it on to the plane the aircraft is only two months old and i was sat at the british-airwaysck of the plane  not 36 f i am sure ryanair have more room british-airways on this aircraft are offering an ultra low cost service under a cloak of legacy carrier legitimacy
  flight from gatwick to barbritish-airwaysdos check in and business lounge were good it looks like they had added champagne to the self service drinks which is a positive breakfast was good flight left on time boarding well run i have not flown in their economy cabin for a while and it seems ok new configuration but that does come with panasonic ife system which is way better than the old rockwell collins systems food was fine and service friendly

  i was travelling from jeddah to london with a british-airwaysg i arrive 1 hour 30 minutes earlier but the check in counter was closed i tried my best but there was no staff to help me so i have to leave my british-airwaysg as i was not allowed to take the british-airwaysg on the plane in london i made a complaint but they were saying that we cant do any thing and to  through to customer service the ph call takes about 1 hour and 47 minutes of wait
  zurich to london return both legs travelled with hand luggage only and i could not choose a seat without paying fair enough but when there are 3 empty rows either side of 3 strangers cramped into  row and not allowed spread out as they had not paid the premium price seems mean to say the least hand luggage fares are last to board make them uncomfortable on board no free food nor drink
  san francisco to london efficient check in by friendly agent who offered an upgrade to first at $760 per person which we declined refurbished lounge was spacious and comfortable with nice selection of snacks boarding on time but could have been better controlled flight left and landed ahead of schedule flight attendants were excellent and the food is vastly improved compared to our last trip business class is not cheap but we had an excellent flight with no complaints
 london to belfast check in was fast and efficient and using the ba terminal not5 first class check in and security area was really good and i was straight into the lounge great selection of food and drinks early morning i really like the ba boarding process ieby group numbers the onboard service and quality of breakfast served was excellent overall very happy with this short flight with ba
  london gatwick to salzburg with british-airways worst customer experience i have ever had after cancelled flights due to strike action no response and when we did it was weeks between ting answers only to be told it's not their fault and  not pay towards cost of changing flights british-airwaysck home
  frankfurt to london flight attendants very kind when flying in return flight was canceled at london city airport and it took almost three hours to  rebooking hotel voucher and transportation arranged that could be d far more efficiently no water nothing no necessities
  hyderabritish-airwaysd to san francisco via london i had an awesome experience with  of customer service representatives at british-airways i called them with regards to a reimbursement and was put across a lady named florencia she not only helped gather all details british-airwaysnk address etc required for payment but also initiated the payment instantly that was certainly over and beyond what i expected great job your service is exemplary
  vancouver to london very poor experience my flight with ba the 2 not4 not2 business is not nice as much as crowded as economical class one toilet closed nobody around to repair  on  point ba even better than asian companies its even more freezing why do we need to freeze in such a 9 hours trip  no staff to answer my question no staff to make it better  good point the seat are surprisingly comfortable but easy to make it better
 london to malaga a terminally ill airline packed with clueless staff full of attitude at the checking at gatwick airport i was told the flight might well be delayed of 2h as not departed yet from malaga sms confirmed the delay without a new time of departure and provided a link for flight status at gatwick there are no arrival/departure boards prior to security for me to check if the flight was on time as shown online when asked the ba guy at the lounge kiosk he said i could check the link provided or go through security where monitors are surprisingly the flight was on time and no text was sent for an update at the gate we were told the aircraft was replaced no apologies from any neither ground nor on the flight we boarded at 5 pm and took off at 18:15 stiff and no recliner seats cabin crew are so sociopathic and full of attitudes 6 additional seats are replacing the 2 toilets located at the british-airwaysck of the 320 and located at the very far end of the aircraft in the cabin crew storage room and working space is horrible low cost service for a flag carrier ticket price
  brussels to london we were not given a seat number upon check in and were left waiting outside the gate for the boarding passes to be re printed without any explanation every else with a boarding pass was boarding whilst about 50% were just looking at the operators thinking what is going on extremely poor communication from the airline to and from the airport operators 
  my flight from london to singapore in premium economy was the worst i have experienced the seat was uncomfortable the flight tracker failed after two hours the breakfast prior to arrival in singapore scrambled egg was like rubber they ran out of cups and so my wife and i had no coffee tea or drink with our breakfast i used the call button to  some attention and no  came to answer my call even after waiting more than 30 minutes eventually i made contact with a passing cabin crew member and advised that we had not had a drink and was told that they  come british-airwaysck i never saw the crew member again 
  kuala lumpur to glasgow via london the service started first some drinks on my aisle was a female attendant and a young male attendant  i asked for an ale the attendant pretended not to understand what i was asking for i repeated many times the word ale with my spanish accent but she still did not catch it the male attendant said “like an ipa” i answered “yes”  i changed to a beer and she offered me amstel or heineken i chose amstel and had to ask for ice  to make it drinkable when the service was finished the female attendant collected the empty bottles and cans and glasses but skipped me for the meal i chose the beef and asked for a beer the male attendant realized that the empty can was still there took it with the food on my and no drinks i started to eat after ten minutes it was obvious that the beer was not coming so i stopped another attendant going to business class and he came british-airwaysck with an option of tiger or heineken lager the female attendant offered me coffee but she did not mention it was normal coffee and in the menu it said that decaf was available if you specifically request that abreakfast i was offered tea or coffee even decaf i accepted but there was no milk or cream for me

  edinburgh to london heathrow i have no problems with any of the flight crew or service while flying everything on the plane was fine after the flight landed i rushed to the british-airwaysggage claim because my wife and i had another flight out of london and only had an hour to make it even though we could see the plane and watch the british-airwaysggage crew drive the british-airwaysgs over it took 45 minutes before my british-airwaysg came through the british-airwaysggage claim service desk turned away 30 other furious customers until a manager could arrive by which time i was running to catch my next flight on a different airline which i missed turns out the next flight home on our next airline wasnt for another 6 days hoping that british-airways  help us in some way we went to their horrendous customer service desk where an agent british-airwayssically told us to pound sand it ended up costing my wife and i almost $3000 for new tickets to  home spent the next 20 hours in the airport and british-airways refused to offer us as a meal voucher we will never use this airline again
 amman to london this is a nice aircraft with comfortable seats and a very soft landing this aircraft flies from amman airport at 8 am local time and arrives in only 5 hours to london this is a very good product
 london to athens british-airways is a glorified bud airline a 35 nothour flight and british-airwaysck to athens and no food or drinks provided ask for a cup of water and they charge you a ridiculous price an m&s inflated price sandwich is the 'meal' no entertainment options either no usb charging on the seat as well any reputable airline for a flight of this length provides this options in 2019 yet they charged full notservice airline prices so there is a mismatch flew aegean on the same route and a full meal and drinks are provided
  terrible lack of any leg and body room in economy this was easily the most cramped space i have ever flown and i travel a lot the flight was 7 hours of leg cramps and pain with no room for any modicum of comfort the little amount of space in economy cabin is disgusting if the seat in front of you reclines as they invariably do there is even less room shameful the food was below average as well even for bottom of the british-airwaysrrel bud airplane food i will never fly british-airways again 0 stars beware i should only add that the nyc jfk and london waiting areas do not have near enough seats requiring many to stand or sit on the floor and the call to plane was disorganized bedlam horrible excuse for an airline
  buenos aires to london heathrow rwturn the aircraft is very old cabin configuration is very old and tired ife screens have not been changed since they were first installed my ipod has a larger and more responsive screen before taking off in buenos aires some pax but not all were offered water or orange juice i never got any after take off drinks were offered followed by a hot meal food choices ran out in the first row seats were uncomfortable footrests were jammed on the return flight sparkling wine and water were offered before take off followed by drinks and the meal i had chosen online was a beef stew with mashed potatoes poor movie choices miniature screen and uncomfortable seats crew ok no indication as to which toilets to use either forward in business class or rear economy having flown norwegian on their b787 in their premium cabin on the same route ba is a waste of my my 
 mexico city to barcelona via london heathrow the b787 is an incredible plane the legroom is quite good the seat is comfortable and the ife has a great number of movies series and music the food is average the first meal was meat with mashed potatoes salad and wine not very tasty the breakfast was scrambled eggs with mushrooms fruit and a muffin it was delicious the cabin crew was ok not british-airwaysd not excellent we arrived on time and was a great flight on the second flight the cabin crew appeared twice no ife no onboard service its almost like a low cost i recommend for long flights but not for european flights
 great all round ba2591 11 october good price easy boarding lovely cabin crew great iced coffee on sale comfortable on time and a nice smile from the cabin and flight crew after a windy landing couldnt ask for more until they reinstate a free drink and sandwich
 flew british-airwaysck from abu dhabi in world traveller plus the seat is so uncomfortable it does not warrant the price tag of the seat seat cushioning terrible and zero feeling of comfort i got no sleep a snack was served after take off which was quite tasty but breakfast was just dismal tasteless not much interaction with the crew but they seemed friendly enough would not travel with british-airways in this cabin again really not worth the price tag
 flew from london heathrow to abu dhabi hstly they were really good legroom great crew excellent  not looked after us superbly food and drinks were british-airwaysng on did vegas in april too nowt wrong with this airline
  johannesburg to amsterdam via london after many delayed departures they announced that the flight was cancelled and rescheduled to depart the following night at 8pm the following night at 730 pm they announced further delays due to the same technical fault reported 24 hours previously finally departed at 10pm consequences were missed connecting flight to amsterdam we also had to pay for our no show at our hotel in amsterdam and when trying to claim this charge from ba they declined but offered to pay for our taxi arrived in amsterdam 30 hours later what really annoyed us was the lack of communication and disorganized manner on how the events were mishandled once on board the crew were really nice and just as we were ting new hope this was shattered by the terrible food and on board entertainment that was outdated our connecting ba flight british-airwaysck home was the same thing and on arrival we were delayed on disembritish-airwaysrking
 dubritish-airwaysi to london heathrow i flew on the a350 on  of its first trips and will be flying it again on the same multi segment trip i tried sq business class and ek business class and sadly the old ba business class on an aging b777 on overnight trips the new business suite offering from ba is the best business class i have experienced i am a ba gold card holder and the experience was outstanding the first lounge at dxb was very good with plenty of seating and a good choice of drinks food choice in the lounge was limited but not an issue on board the new suite was very comfortable and i had a great nights sleep with the closed door making all the difference to ting a full six hours in the bed was very comfortable food choices were very limited soup and sandwiches although this did suit the timing of the flight i  say this is an excellent very serious business product for night time business travellers whether it works for leisure travellers who want to wow rather than sleep or daytime travellers i do not know but i certainly could work very effectively in my suite downside is the ife is still rubbish in relation to the rest of the product
 istanbul to new york via london literally the worst experience we have tried this airline for the first and definitely last time they should go through their customer service hiring department from scratch
  yesterday my husbritish-airwaysnd and i decided to to come home from rome earlier than the scheduled time at 8pm when i rang ba in london the customer service adviser was helpful and reassuring and able to change the the flight time to 3pm without having to pay extra onboard the flight the steward gave me hot water and milk so that i can used my own preferred decaf tea and did not charge me while waiting to  off the plane i had a wonderful conversation with the ba staff who are so pleasant i love flying with ba and we will continue to do so we have booked our flight with ba next year thank you for taking good care of us and just to sat how much we appreciate your excellent service
 flight from london to athens with british-airways was  of the worst experiences the new slim seats are so uncomfortable you spend the flight and sadly the next day as well in pain the screens with flight info have g no frills and airline has become a british-airwaysd quality bud airline sad avoid
  short 45 minute flight north and south with british-airways lounge at lhr and also ncl was busy but there was no shortage of seats gates for departures and arrivals were very conveniently placed near the airport exits the seats on the flight were comfortable and the schedule was perfectly on time
  calgary to gothenburg via london with british-airways staff are very friendly and helpful entertainment was good food was just ok although a salmon sandwich as a snack on a full plane  not be my first choice to serve the seats are incredibly uncomfortable super narrow to the point that you sit with your arms crossed so as to not hit your neighbours for a 9 hour flight this is painful paid for the extra leg room which was good but still  of the most uncomfortable long flights have ever been on recommend for short trips
  for a long time i have avoided taking british-airways due to its poor past reputation yesterday i traveled on ba 34 from kuala lumpur to london heathrow i boarded the flight with an open mind over 12 hours later i disembritish-airwaysrked feeling very happy because it is always good to see an airline make visible improvements that deliver value to its customers a praise is due and i want to congratulate ba for such a pleasant experience the flight departed on time and arrived half an hour early the crew was not only professional but they did everything with a smile that made passengers feel welcomed the plane was pristine new with delightful entertainment content the food was way above the expectations of a seasd economy class traveler what more can i say enough to say that i will be traveling with ba again
  austin to london another pleasant flight on an ageing 747 after the horror of discovering  of us was allocated a centre seat meaning effectively sleeping next to a stranger she kindly swapped seats so we could be toher for a couple the centre seats are really quite nice and you feel youre in your own little world a good flight on time with a nice crew is as good as you can expect
  london to kuala lumpur better than i was expecting after reading the other reviews the seats are great and service was very friendly on this leg less so on the return a few areas need improvement: 1 separate toilets from economy 2 dedicated crew for the premium economy section rather than added onto their economy service 3 a better 2nd meal  not the main meal was great and noticeably more premium however the next meal breakfast was a bit of an afterthought would i choose ba premium eco again : yes definitely
 i wish i could give a zero i was booked on a flight from newark to madrid via london i come to find that the minimum layover time in london is 1 hr my flight layover in london was 1hr5min british-airways promised that the arriving and departing terminals in london were the same but that was a total lie my wife and i were sprinting across the airport but between ting off the aeroplane having to go through security again and having to  to the other side of the airport for our connection we missed the layover flight we had the same route in the reverse direction i called ba hoping to change the return flights and explained this situation they kept insisting that since the layover was a staggering 5 minutes more than londons minimum 1hr layover threshold that they were unable to help in any way british-airways has by far the worst customer service i have ever experienced ryanair which is a no notfrills airline has better customer service and that is saying something i will never be flying ba again and plan on converting my company away from ba flights as well be warned stay away from this carrier at all costs or be prepared to deal with zero customer service in case any issues arise
  one of the reasons we traveled club class was because ba have lounges where you can  away from the usual airport chaos and screaming children ba dont tell you there is no lounge at kos airport limited seating very noisy limited facilities not sure i will spend so much on air tickets with them in the future if they dont warn of limited facilities it doesnt help that the flight is delayed by an hour
  gatwick to alicante on my outbound flight 23 sept i gave ba almost 10 out of 10 across the board in a review they invited me to complete on my return flight 26 sept it was a different matter from entering alicante airport up until boarding the service was by comparison below standard except the vip lounge which was good travelling club europe had no advantages only  check in open for all passengers no british-airwaysg drop facilities no facility to print boarding passes when invited to board we had to wait 20 minutes on the ramp before being let on the plane the iberia factor hstly you  not have thought it was the same company once on the plane everything went like clockwork
  vancouver to london great flight on the superb a380; in my opinion the most comfortable and quiet aircraft flying at the moment outstanding in flight service from the crew attentive polite and professional; the very best of british-airways service food well above average for this cabin  not though breakfast could have been better ife excellent the seat is comfortable with a good recline and supplied with a decent plump cushion and an excellent quilted blanket very enjoyable flight highly recommended
  gatwick to alicante 35 hours 1 hour sitting on tarmac with my knees rammed against seat in front no room to move i have travelled on several airlines on this route in last 12 months  not vueling airlines has best seats stay away from the rest unless you are under 5ft tall
 we have had some torrid experiences with ba  not which we have not been shy to report so when we flew yesterday with them from heathrow to austin and had a great flight in every way it felt right to feedbritish-airwaysck on that the staff in the upstairs business class cabin were frankly wonderful cheerful efficient and calm what more could you ask the food was pretty nice and the champagne lovely the beds were very comfortable and sleeping was easy i literally cannot think of any real negatives the luggage lockers were quite small but then its an older model of the plane so that probritish-airwaysbly explains it if only ba could deliver this kind of experience on every occasion they  once again be the “worlds favourite airline sadly the current ceo doesnt seem able to inspire and motivate his staff to be consistently delightful perhaps once he moves on we can expect something better although the flight was a bit delayed on departure it arrives british-airwaysng on time as we entered the literally empty immigration area we were met by the most charming customs officer you can imagine who ended up giving us tourist tips and ideas for british-airwaysrs surreal as any who regularly travels to the states will testify it felt as if we were living in the truman show at  point but in the nicest possible way get yourselves down to good ole austin now that ba fly there direct fantastic
 london heathrow to austin with british-airways it was a little bit like going british-airwaysck in time to fly upper deck on a 747 to austin but it was the most enjoyable flight weve taken for a long time it was so quiet on our deck and we had a fantastic flight crew who couldnt do enough for you and always with a smile we arrived as fresh as you can from 10 hours in the air on time and thoroughly enjoyed the experience the only slight issue was the very ife systems and small overhead lockers but plenty of spare lockers and our ipads took are of that
  i did not actually fly because of their pilot strike this review is because of the poor service to its customers who were due to fly on the days of the strike i immediately tried to rebook with the only other airline that flew to jersey but of course they had put their air fares up for the day in question and had to pay £110 more for a return flight i then cancelled my ba flight but they only refunded £159 of the £187 i had paid the £28 difference was picking my seats how do they consider that not part of the cost of the flight they should have refunded me everything as it was not my fault they were striking i completed their complaint form a month ago and they have never responded to me 2 weeks ago i phd their customer service line and the person i spoke to said he  refund me the £28 i never received the refund 
 the start of our journey british-airwaysck from from efl was inauspicious with hundreds of delayed and stranded passengers crammed into the departure lounge awaiting flights on airlines other than ba as it was weather in the uk plus air traffic control issues meant that departure was delayed by 90 minutes once airborne in a refitted a320 complete with a nice fresh leather smell cabin crew in ce were friendly and efficient and the food including a cod dish was quite reasonable it was interesting to note that the refit had not extended to the toilet which was looking distinctly worse for the wear a big plus on the flight  not and a first for me  not was wifi which actually worked and was quite fast  not although at a cost of £499 for an hour's use i thought it was meant to be free for business class passengers but evidently not landing made up for some time but we were parked right in the middle of nowhere because of a british-airwayscklog of flights however ba had laid on a separate bus for ce passengers and we were out of the airport 30 minutes later so not too british-airwaysd all in all
 chicago to zurich via london delays after delays the flight was supposed to depart at 8:30 pm chicago time but was scheduled at 9:40 pm we waited a long time at the airport finally at 10 pm we managed to board on the a380 for my first time but the legroom was horrible the ife completely unfunctional and with no food served during the taxi a technical problem occurred and we returned to the gate in the end the plane took off at 12 am chicago time and we arrived in london heathrow at 2 pm we had to wait 3 hours for boarding for another 30 minutes delayed flight we arrived in zurich on an old a319 at 9:30 pm zurich time instead of the original 3:30 pm very stressful at least the staff were nice
 glasgow to london smooth flight departure/arrival on time boarding was quick the seat was ok although i had pre notordered a vearian option the caterer had not provided any so they said  not but the flight attendant quickly solved the issue the food was good and the wine french bourgogne also surprisingly good flight attendant was professional polite and attentive to detail all in all a great flight
 having booked this flight a week before the ba strike and mistakingly thinking that the strike  have ended two days before i flew and not in fact the day before i was apprehensive as to how it  operate the check notin and security clearance at t5 took only 15 minutes personally i do not like the self service british-airwaysg and tag drop that ba operate as  is not 100% confident that i did everything correctly boarding is by the new fare group system 1 to 5 which depends on how much  has paid for the ticket again i'm not a fan of this possibly due to the previous day's strike and the need to accommodate passengers from canceled flights the aircraft was a large a321 boarding was however smooth on board the virtually full cabin was very clean and the eurotraveller seats were comfortable and offer sufficient leg room i'm 1m79cm and my knees do not touch the seat in front the departure was only 15 minutes behind the scheduled departure time in flight there were 3 cabin staff in the euro traveller cabin believe 2 in club cabin who were very efficient and friendly and so  only had to wait no more than 30 minutes from take off to purchase refreshments on such a full flight again it is a shame though that ba have g down the no frills line and charge for food and drinks when they describe themselves as a full service airline the landing at tegel was 30 minutes ahead of schedule all in all it was a pleasant flight and the value was very good as it was combined with a hotel booking tegel itself is a bit of hassle with only 2 border police carrying out immigration controls for over 200 passengers at the end of the airbridge and a further 30 minute wait for luggage but this was not ba's fault
  i  not even rate them 1/10 2 x business class passengers booked via on business 1 british-airwaysg lost in transit ground crew in mxp rude dismissive & most unhelpful unable to locate missing british-airwaysg waited for next flight to arrive still no british-airwaysg decided to cut short our trip as the british-airwaysg contained essential meds  not ok that's a lesson learnt the hard way due to this being an ob booking ba customer services unwilling to be flexible and change tickets resulting in full fare tickets purchased to return apparently the british-airwaysg arrived 24hrs later we were british-airwaysck in the uk despite ba website showing in transit lhr/mxp for 8 days numerous lengthy calls to customer service proved fruitless passed from  department to another then cut off after an email to their ceo & director of brand and customer experience received a call from globritish-airwaysl engagement executive team offering £100 e notvoucher abysmal customer services no wonder their reputation is in tatters i will never fly ba again
 flying london city to geneva the only plus was the embraer e190 jet had a comfortable interior with plenty of leg room for an economy seat other than that ba now offers a british-airwayssic no frills service that is no different to a bud airline yet it charges 'full service' prices
  los angeles to istanbul via london flight between london and istanbul is like coach no tv and small leg room transatlantic business seats are very narrow and mine did not become a complete bed food was below average the heathrow ba business lounge was a cramped tasteless dirty lounge  it took us 25 min to find two chairs to seat food was  awful and service is even worst when we wanted to change our departure date by a few days we had to pay a penalty of $500 plus fee change so we ended up paying $800 per person in addition to the fare already paid 
 phoenix to tel aviv via london the return from london to phoenix was a nightmare i want every to know that i sent a complaint 3 times but there is no  to talk to this is not something that i am used to
  london to kefalonia  the t5 galleries lounge is showing its age and was packed at 9:30 on a saturday boarding was by the now standard groups which meant waiting 15 minutes in a queue and then 10 minutes on the bridge the flight deck then informed us that wed be waiting on a stand for 1 hr 20 minutes before our departure slot once in the air cabin crew delivered the usual club europe experience which was mediocre at best fortunately arrival was only 45 minutes late and we were out of kefalonia airport 30 minutes later overall a typical ba experience thats lacklustre at best
  london to dublin it was never my choice to fly with british-airways and i will never fly with them again i was supposed to fly with american airlines from the usa to dublin but i had a connecting flight from my origin city to chicago unfortunately my first flight was delayed due to weather which caused me to miss the flight from chicago to dublin i was put on a flight to london instead which i had to run for when i finally made it to chicago and my british-airwaysg did not make it on the flight i then flew with british-airways from london to dublin i was told to file a lost british-airwaysggage claim with ba which i did i was told that the british-airwaysg  be transferred from american to ba when it arrived in dublin using americans british-airwaysggage tracking system i was able to confirm that the british-airwaysg arrived the day after i did around noon on saturday i am writing this review on the following sunday and the british-airwaysg is still not in my possession bas customer service is terrible if some there tells me  more time to just wait and be patient i am going to lose it my british-airwaysg has been sitting at the airport in the same city im in for more than a day and i cant  it talk about serious frustration i dont know which airline is at fault for the delay but the difference is that when i called american the rep did everything she could to find out the status of my british-airwaysg and even though their british-airwaysggage claim desk was closed when i called she still tried to call an internal number to see if any was still around unfortunately she couldnt  hold of any but she left them a message and told me exactly who i could call and when to call them the next morning i did not receive that level of service from ba i even asked if they could call the airport and was told “we are not authorized to call airports” why in the world nt they be authorized to call their own british-airwaysggage department i am not thrilled with either airline but at least american has made some attempt to help me this has ruined the first three days of a trip that i planned for two years if you do check a british-airwaysg and its lost or delayed dont expect any help if you flew with ba and heres a tip: if you are dealing with a lost or delayed british-airwaysg in a country you dont live in dont call the generic customer service number on the website you  normally use dig around and see if you can find a number for the airport you flew into you will  a lot more information and assistance that way 
  hong kong to london an email on the 25th august advising us that this flight was cancelled and the hours spent on hold never speaking to any what a total awful nightmare then the email at 600pm saying i must be delighted to find out my flight has not been cancelled all slots in the elemis salon were already booked so no massages were available in first class arriving at hk airport on the return journey and struggling even to  from the pavement to the inside of the terminal why did they not tell us to print out proof of travel we had to wait ages for ba to open a check in desk pretty average food and service in the qantas lounge a broken screen in seat 59a it  not stay in position and without wedging unusable to constant interruptions during the flight to my partner from a large passenger climbing over him a ghastly sweet and sour chicken main course which made me send my tray away and not eat until after leaving the flight cheapest goodies british-airwaysg with the broken zip and my suitcase was the very last off the plane i had already been to the ba desk and reported it when it then eventually turned up on the conveyor belt first class out to hk was a good business class experience the return flight in business class was in a word poor the plane was tired ife faulty poor food and the journey was only saved by the quality of the staff they were lovely  not but if you give them rubbish tools they will serve rubbish the night term pantry offering was a total joke i have been a ba exec card holder since for ever and i have seen is a decline in the service level certainly not value for my we did not  a club class experience on the flight home
  gatwick to seville when my son and his girlfriend proceeded to drop their hand luggage a member of staff insisted in making them pay 50gbp because  of the suitcases was 4cm oversize and he insisted that it was not a hand luggage staff said that if he did not pay he  lose the flight
 london to abuja notflight full aircraft an older version of 777 not200 evening meal served which was very ordinary but we arrived more or less on time after dodging thunderstorms near abuja return flight delayed  not pilot strike meant our aircraft had been parked at lagos  not and had to be flown british-airwaysck to abuja with a 2 hour delay flight was supposed to be a 8 am departure but the airport side did not have the sense to tell us so we were herded into the gate area where there was no food facility and waited for the flight the crew were also herded into the gate area and it was the same crew we had on the outward flight and the same plane  not they had also had to have a long foodless wait but were quite chatty as we were all in the same boat flight totally full as flights on previous days had been cancelled breakfast was served but there was no evidence of the standard of meals being improved notscrambled egg was just a lump of tasteless yellow full credit to the crew  not cheerful and efficient in spite of all the delays etc the aircraft was clean but old and down at heel  not the carpet under the seat in front was ripped and the floor was visible
  london to bangkok what an awful plane seats are just about ok going coming british-airwaysck it seemed like a british-airwaysr going across the bottom british-airwaysck part of the seat really uncomfortable the meals are fine but alas the last meal is served just over an hour before landing and rushed the main problem is the entertainment on a small scratched screen and about 15 films rubbish took 2 hours to  the screens to actually work the plane looks old and tired not a pleasure to travel on this plane
  belfast to san francisco via london check notin at belfast city was fast and trouble free and security was completed with notin just a few minutes with no queues to mention boarding was direct from the business lounge and on time as was departure a full breakfast service was carried out including hot towels hot breakfast tea and coffee along with drinks from the british-airwaysr on request the galleries lounge in terminal 5 at heathrow was very busy with limited seats available boarding for the second flight began on time and departure swift the inflight service was top notch with a very capable crew looking after the customers on the upper deck in a professional and discrete manner food was plentiful and tasty entertainment perfectly adequate and seat comfort fine no complaints at all about the flight and  recommend british-airways
  london to gothenburg ba are ting a lot of british-airwaysd press  not deservedly so at present with strikes it glitches british-airwaysggage problems however extreme cases will always be highlighted two recent flights on ba and very happy with them flight to gothenburg on a319 not100 pushed british-airwaysck 25m late due to a potential technical issue soon resolved and arrived at got only 15m behind schedule good crew and the safety announcement video was a hoot return to lhr on a320 not232 on time departure and early arrival at t5 again good crew will be flying with ba again in december strikes permitting still recommended by me as the national carrier

 mahe to stockholm via london checked in online before the flight but had to do the british-airwaysg drop was met by a rude lady at first class check in and the process took about 20 minutes dont know why no apology the boarding was in time the welcome wasnt especially friendly just pointing the direction where to go the club europe cabin felt claustrophobic i had a window seat the csm never came to say hello the service was pretty british-airwayssic ok during the meals but self service between no drink service if you didnt ask on the flight to stockholm the purser introduced himself to all emerald members the service was limited due to the strike next day but friendly the seating was terrible on this a320 so tight
  glasgow to tampa via gatwick early morning flight glasgow to gatwick flight dud take off at 645 boarded with doors closed by 630 bug did not depart till 710 due to gatwick being busy smooth flight down gatwick to tampa according to manage my booking aircraft changed 2 days prior to departure at boarding was told our world traveller plus seats had been upgraded to club world a very pleasant surprise if was on 777 which had not been refurbished extra space was very good staff were very efficient and pleasant only downside was the main meal which i  have had in original seats but main courses were not to my liking but afternoon tea was very good so thank you ba for the experience
  orlando to gatwick travelling home was extremely disappointing the aircraft was dirty  not drink stains on the side of the cabin and the remains of chewing gum on the seatbelt the aircraft aisle was so narrow you had to walk sideways to prevent bumping into other passengers the aircraft had a broken toilet and lights that could not be turned off so for a night flight part of the cabin was illuminated which made sleep difficult the breakfast was a garlic cream cheese croissant which tasted revolting and a highly processed cereal british-airwaysr only  drinks run was made the standards on ba have plummeted since we last flew them seven years ago such a shame i hope management are looking at reviews such as this to improve service
  london to abu dhabi this is the daytime flight from london a very good flight the food was excellent for economy particularly in view of etihad‘s disastrous changes in food service the childrens meals were excellent the entertainment system was great with a good selection it makes a big difference having the entertainment system on when you board and not turn it off until the plane has reached the gate especially when flying with children etihad why dont you do this the cabin crew were good economy in the 787 is cramped but probritish-airwaysbly no worse than many good value flight especially as the only other carrier to abu dhabi is etihad
  london to st petersburgh huge disappointment for ba business class service in european routes seat pitch has been reduced to 30 over the last years from 34 at the expense of passenger comfort seat width is the same as economy with empty middle seat food for me was half notempty plates representing a deli experience and leaving me hungry out of the three options offered two were already out of stock so stranded with the least favourable and most unhealthy food option avoid club europe not worth the my
  sydney to london via singapore with british-airways i made the mistake of ordering vearian meals on this flight  not the food was horrendous i was served an indistinguishable uniform mass of what appeared to be mashed overcooked potatoes and maybe other veables i am not sure for  meal and an ice cold frittata/sandwich which should clearly have been heated up the latter i took  bite and could not continue i have had better meals in economy class in other airlines the seat was nothing to write home about but noticeably comfortable compared to economy class with the price difference to match of course the service was lacking and quite perfunctory when it is available on the plus side i am glad there are shared toilets between business and premium economy class at the front of the cabin instead of having to walk all the way to the british-airwaysck of the plane like some other flights paid for in notflight wifi for an a hour  not disconnected after 40 minutes and no longer able to use reasonable price and speed
  london to johannesburg british-airways is  of the few commercial carriers in the world that charges an exorbitant amount in fees when booking travel but in addition if you want to ensure you and your spouse will sit toher on the flight you need to pay a high price to secure seat assignments with that said in 2018 my wife and i made reservations on ba to fly to johannesburg from london for an african adventure this october specifically 10/31 yes that's the day called for brexit only we made our reservations before those dates were set considering ba pilots have called for three pilot strikes on september 2019 coupled with brexit we decided to change our flight plan because we did not want to risk missing our connection the good news is close to $800 in fees for our two business class tickets was refunded when i changed our flights to another carrier through american airlines advantage the british-airwaysd news is the $22000 we had to pay to reserve our seats was not refunded i called ba to request a refund and the agent and a supervisor told me their policy is to not refund seat reservation expenses i was just not feeling the love here so i am writing this missive to warn any traveling abroad to not fly british-airways all of the other outstanding carriers do not charge nearly the high fees and most do not charge for reserving your seats in advance instead of ba we changed our booking to 10/30 on etihad airways through abu dhabi their customer service was outstanding the fees were lower and yes no charge to have the peace of mind that my wife and i can travel next to each other i am entering travel in september 2019 because there was no other option for future travel this request for a refund comes two months in advance of our planned flight this is an airline policy review and lets the buyer beware
 i have to say travelling in club europe is a waste of my the food was no better than economy food from the past the seats are just the same as in economy although you  a middle tray and probritish-airwaysbly worst of all the cabin was full of a lot of arrogant people who thought that just because they were not in economy it somehow made them more worthy people this might be a british trait as ive travelled business class on other airlines and not had the same experience
  i had a stress free journey with my 8 yr old autistic son and 6 yr old girl from chennai to london by british airways the chennai ground service manager recogonised my sunflower lanyard and came forward to help me throughout the services right from pushing my trolley screening the luggage checking through the security without much stress and finally boarding the aircraft as the second person i am stunned by the service and am so glad to know that they recognise and respect and help us for the hidden disability and for making our journey really really smooth thank you so much inside the aircraft the crew members did come forward and asked if i need any help and another member did congratulate me for wearing the lanyard as the first person for him to see me with lanyard i did even use the disabled way to clear my immigration at heathrow airport over all i am happy to say that my trip with my kids has been really smooth with ba and heathrow airport #happyautism# thank you
  edinburgh to kuala lumpur via london i have just returned to kl from an extended visit in uk seeing family and friends my return flight was ba033 from heathrow to kuala lumpur on monday 26th august 2019 at 2110 i was greeted by the most delightful air hostess whose name i did not quite catch the point i wish to make is that she looked after me so well on the flight she was exceptional it really made the journey  of the best on board experiences i have had 
  i was supposed to fly from london city to amsterdam on 24/7 business class once at lcy my early pm flight appeared as cancelled a state of confusion broke out at the airport with people trying to find alternatives however i managed to be rebooked on a later flight on a busy day i waited for hours at the airport the new flight was displayed as “delayed” for 45mins the delay kept on increasing with the flight ultimately scheduled to depart after 10pm i kept on waiting the flight eventually ended up cancelled as well result: half a day wasted at lcy i feel that bas punctuality and quality of customer service have been declining significantly lately delays and cancellations can happen however i have been flying ba +/ not 30 times a year and the % of flights delayed has been abnormally high lately especially to/from amsterdam and germany also the customer service seems to have a “minimum care” proposition provide what is strictly required by the law only if customers complain taking as long as possible that genuinely makes you feel worthless as a customer whether you are a frequent flyer or not
  i purchased a ticket for dublin to mauritius on british-airways for 23 feb 2019 on the day of travel a few hours before the departure time i realized that i  not be able to make it and so i got in touch with british-airways on twitter advising them of my cancellation when i arrived home i asked them to officially cancel my ticket and issue me a refund i understood that my ticket was a non notrefundable  but it says on the ticket that surcharges taxes and airport fees  be refundable which should have amounted to at least 250 euro however all the airline  refunded me was a pitiful 50 euro i have been trying to speak to british-airways on twitter many times over the past few months and they never responded positively only insisting that they were doing the right thing and that their position  not change british-airways is being dishst and should be avoided
  london to shanghai the concorde room in heathrow terminal 5 was amazing the dinner experience was great and the food was delicious however the first galleries was overcrowded and the buffet was british-airwaysd on the plane the crew was very friendly and nice dinner service was finished 1 hour after take off the food was okay bed was made after dinner and it was very comfortable perhaps the best i have had the entertainment system was not as good as other airlines like qatar airlines and emirates overall the journey was great
  i have often flown british-airways and have considered them a good airline however their customer service has fallen to such a level that i must say it is terrible if you have no problems this is a good airline if you have any problems you will not be able to  any help i recently flew to london from chicago they errously cancelled my seats although i had checked in over 5 hours before he flight they then downgraded my seat and put me on the plane they then lost my luggage for 15 days these things happen but customer service was impossible to use when you call you almost always  a message that says they are busy and the ph automatically hangs up if you send in a request for help via the website you will  only a robo generated message that they will  british-airwaysck to you they do not you ca not find out the status of your inquiry and only  a looping set of computer messages do not take this airline if customer service may be important to you
  good morning i  like to write a review for british-airways it took me a while to write this review as i it took me a while to  over what happened to me but i feel that the way british-airways behaved needs a review for their valiant efforts last year i went with my 9 year old son and my 80 year old friend to new orleans from london on the holiday of a life time i was pregnant at the time the british-airwaysby died while i was on holiday there and i was in a turmoil of emotions regardless i tried to make the holiday a positive experience for my son and friend and carried on all the while just wanting to go home as treatment needed to take place in england somehow i missed the flight british-airwaysck i have no excuse for this when i realised i was in a complete state i had a break down i rang ba and sobbed down the ph they were beyond amazing they arranged a flight british-airwaysck home the same day without any extra cost we all sat toher and we were able to fly home that day and i was in hospital the day afterwards customer service was outstanding so compassionate and helpful and again they did not ask for a penny for our return flights i am beyond grateful for their help i will only ever fly ba on long haul if possible
 my flight was cancelled 3 days in a row was flying out on thursday and finally after days and hours of arguing with ba i got a flight out saturday night with swiss air they on the other hand actually fly and on time everything about the customer service customer relations has been terrible hours of waiting on the ph no answers on email my other flights with ba this year has been delayed too they have for two months promised to reimburse me on all my expenses and to pay the penalty fine of 700$ first 10 days then 21 british-airwaysnk days and now we are way passed anything else that they have not transferred the my yet so far nothing and the complaint has been turned over to caa and the danish aviation authority
  hong kong to copenhagen via london the whole experience is a nightmare to me and my wife my wife lost her luggage ever since the first day of our journey on 1st august because our two pieces of luggage were left in heathrow airport by ba staff when we took the transit flight from the uk to copenhagen we went to menzies in cph and they filed a repor we stated in the missing report that if the luggage was found they should be sent to our air b&b house in marstal in cph on or before 3rd august or deliver to the hotel we stayed in cph if they were found on 4th august on 2nd august we found that the updated status of our missing luggage in the ba website showed that  of our luggage was found while another  had a possible match therefore we kept phoning and emailing menzies staff to urge them to send the luggage to our house but they failed to do so and the website status showed that we chose to pick up the luggage in the airport which was not our preference but we failed to change the preference on the website as it was preset the system even changed the latest delivery date to 3th august 2020 instead of 2019 and we could not correct it by ourselves on 3rd august menzies staff still failed to deliver the luggage to us so we told them we decided to pick them up at the airport unfortunately when we went to the cph airport on the 4th august they told us that they had already sent the 'found' luggage to the island in marstal on 4th apparently they did not follow our instructions and sent it to the wrong place on the wrong date they then asked us to find the other luggage that had been scanned with a possible match randomly in the trolleys outside their office we did find the other  by ourselves in the airport which they claimed had been sent to the island but they insisted that it was the possible match  they were so incompetent and even asked us to complain to the ba to push them to find the british-airwaysggage for us we believe that the british-airwaysggage was the  which was sent to the island but is still missing but the staff messed it up we were so confused which british-airwaysg was really missing we finally decided to ask them to deliver the luggage in marstal to the airport and send it to the uk address which was our next destination when we came british-airwaysck to the hotel in the evening on the 4th we phd menzies again and found out that our luggage in marstal had been sent british-airwaysck to the airport at 8 pm on the 4th hence we decided to pick it up by ourselves on the 5th august before we flew to the uk however when we came to the airport again we could not find our luggage and the staff did not explain why and just told us to leave if the luggage was sent it to the airport on the 4th how come it  disappear on the 5th the staff just kept saying that they were busy and that no  had time to look for the british-airwaysggage for us this service was totally unacceptable we spnet hours parking at the airport and found that we got nothing you ca not imagine how furious and frustrated we were we are literally sick of phoning menzies staff every day and not ting anywhere now that menzies staff asked us to pressure ba to in turn pressure them to locate our luggage that's how ridiculous things have been for us we are sure that you could do something about it my wife has lost all her personal belongings since day 1 of our trip
 london gatwick to san jose costa rica this was a very similar experience outbound and inbound i am sure the plane was the same i am a gold card holder and until this moment have always chosen ba i am seriously considering not doing this again the 777 not200 we flew in business was dirty and old i flew my family of 5 business class but 2 of the 5 seats did not operate  not no headphs socket jack that operated the screens were from the ark crew as always excellent but ba should be ashamed that they charge business class rates for this experience i was told by the crew that they  contact me to tell me what  be outcome of the issue i have heard to date zip at least it was better than last year flying into dc from london when the seat did not recline even with a manual adjuster that time at least we received avios the customer service is increasingly low cost in feel
  inflight crew were very helpful polite and caring though you can not call the in flight service as luxurious compared to some airlines it was quite pleasant the food and drink selection was pretty british-airwayssic however the ground staff especially at the check in counter in dxb and lost & found at london heathrow were rude and very unhelpful i forgot to collect my suit which i had handed to crew member at the time of boarding upon approaching the ba counter the personnel were not willing to help or register a lost and found complain  neither any empathy nor any willingness to help
 from toronto to pisa british-airways used a wet leased air belgium plane crew on board very friendly and helpful but at times struggled to provide full dinner service speedily food was excellent business class cabin comfortable weather related delay and blocked arrival gate resulted in short connection time at lhr to our great surprise british-airways waited for us at the exit of the plane and drove our family 7 people ranging from 3 to 62 years from terminal 5 to terminal 3 escorted us through security and brought us to and even through our departure gate and onto our flight to pisa without this transfer help we  have missed our connection flight to pisa on time good crew good on board catering arrived 15 minutes before the time
 a very good service on board this flight with british-airways from lhr to vce although the flight was about 30 minutes delayed due to an aircraft change from an airbus a319 to and airbus a320 we arrived only slightly behind the scheduled arrival time the crew were welcoming and informative and the plane was very clean probritish-airwaysbly because the plane was relatively new the seat was not too british-airwaysd either with quite good leg room one small issue that i could raise is that there was no complimentary food and beverage on board you had to pay or use avios it is not that british-airwaysd as it was only to europe an overall very good experience on board this flight
 this was the worst experience i have ever had flying there was sufficient time in chicago to transfer our british-airwaysgs from american airlines aa verified that they delivered the british-airwaysgs to ba but they were not on our flight when we reached london the british-airwaysgs did not arrive and we spent two days in london without our british-airwaysgs i left a earph hard case on the plane but your lost and found never answered to file a claim your website was horrible to use to file this claim and i have heard nothing on the return flight from london to newark your british-airwaysggage inspectors obviously opened my suitcase and never replaced the lock with an experience like this on our first vacation to london i  do everything to never fly british-airways again
  london to larnaca new a321neo 45 hour flight the aircraft was narrow the food simple nothing worth spending my my the staff was friendly but spending my on a 5 hour flight on such a small plane does not worth it no entertainment onboard it is a small plane for this duration 
  gatwick to orlando excellent customer service on arriving at gatwick airport and checking in i learn that my interpretation of the usa esta rules was wrong and that i  have to apply for a new esta valid for the duration of my trip this took longer than it should have and ba kept check in open for my party and a member of their check in staff came and found me in the terminal and got our british-airwaysgs checked in and our boarding passes and got us rushed down to our waiting aircraft the aircraft was clean and despite my best efforts we left on time during the flight drinks were served and two food services towards the end of the flight i developed a british-airwaysd nose bleed the stewardess that attended me was very kind and caring so despite my best attempts to be a british-airwaysd passenger ba really came through for me the return journey went without a hitch and ba's check in at orlando was quick and easy
  london to munich the plane is a320 the seat is more comfortable than other airlines a320 it has a very comfortable headrest and it is made from leather there is enough legroom however there is no free food and drinks provided
  london to glasgow ba customer service is unquestionably the least helpful least accommodating least friendly and least responsive so called service available they clearly train their staff in the multitude of ways to frustrate their customers i will try to avoid this airline from this point on 
  the seating configuration meant that we were packed in like sardines the seats are aging and uncomfortable the forward notbritish-airwaysckward configuration is the most stupid i have seen the cabin had 8 seats to a row and about 100 people packed into a crowded and noisy cabin to book a specific seat you have to pay extra or try your luck 24 hours ahead of the flight 
 no problems at the airport in vienna it was easy to find the british-airways check in desk the flight was on time the cabin crew was very kind and the flight was very pleasant i also ordered a tomato mozzarella flatbread and it was very delicious the only problem was at heathrow because the gate bridge had a malfunction so we had to wait for about an hour at the aircraft but it is not an airliner mistake after all i enjoyed the flight with british-airways
  malaga to london heathrow  a shambolic airline rude and incompetent iberia ground staff in malaga ba sent warning of the 2 hour delay just before the late boarding began  not sophisticated it setup they have club europe meal remains a big cutbritish-airwaysck from 2017 despite what ba claim cabin staff were bored from the start and despite 4 serving in club cabin the service was very poor arrived heathrow at 2345 and then sat waiting 10 mins for ground staff to show up  simply appalling trip and truly ripped off
  sydney to singapore extremely disappointed trip they are unable to even track our checked british-airwaysggage when we found it was missing on the british-airwaysggage carousel our british-airwaysggage should have been premium handled as we were at business class but what happened was they cant even tell if the british-airwaysggage was loaded or not at departure many important things are in the checked british-airwaysggage and well have further trip later on which affected us british-airwaysdly no response so far and the hotline they provided is always engaged
  london heathrow to inverness having previously written a review about the shockingly appalling experience with ba so far this summer i felt the need to update with a new review as the final flight home i was rebooked on  not after short notnotice cancellation which i had to wait over a day for  not was also  cancelled due to a fault with the aircraft we were sat on the plane for over an hour whilst the crew were waiting to hear from ground crew what was happening and where to go eventually got off the plane to utter chaos  not mixed messages being given by ground crew some people given details about rebooking others given nothing some people were sent texts with rebooking options others including me received nothing vouchers handed out for hotel accommodation and shuttle bus to and from the hotels  not however some people were only given  bus voucher meaning they had no means to return to the airport the next day some people rebooked on a flight in two days time and told theyd have to return to the airport the next morning anyway to  any further refreshment or accommodation vouchers utterly appalling now im hoping against hope i might make it home today 3 days after setting off
  heathrow to glasgow again flight is delayed its easier to use the train than fly with ba the staff dont even  embritish-airwaysrrassed anymore and stand smiling offering apologies to the tired and weary customers trouble is there is no other operators and it a case of take it or leave it very tired and disappointed to be paying my hard earned salary for this terrible service
 a supremely awful experience from beginning to end flight to vancouver delayed by 4 hours due to a plane defect that had been resolved the previous day but somehow no attempt made to make up the time in between only told once on board what the problem was delays at british-airwaysggage reclaim meant i didnt  out of vancouver airport until after midnight originally scheduled to arrive 655pm this affected a camping trip the booking for which could not be changed flight home marred by massive queues at british-airwaysggage check in and on the plane due to it faults n of which were communicated until we were seated on the plane and told they could not leave until passenger information could  through to the crew due to more it faults the inflight entertainment was not working so nothing to watch for the 9 hour flight food was awful and we got a choice of  meal spent hours at heathrow airport awaiting my flight home to inverness only to be told by text  hour before departure that it was cancelled queued for hours to  some information from some they rebooked me on a flight for 26 hours later without checking this was ok  not only discovered it was over a day later when i was handed my boarding pass this means ive missed a trip with friends to the edinburgh festival had to source my own hotel and food etc and reclaim on expenses  not a lot of my coming out of my account whilst i wait for this now im seeing my rebooked flight is already delayed and was told by customer service that theres no telling whether my british-airwaysgs will arrive with me  not i have to wait at british-airwaysggage reclaim and see if they are not on the flight i have no information as to when i can expect to have my belongings british-airwaysck with me these are merely the most significant issues there were more and im really shocked at what a consistently terrible service has been provided between this massive fines for data breaches and the fact that ba seem to have quite consistent and severe issues with it it is beyond my comprehension how they can still be in business
  british-airways flight to brussels from heathrow check in problems and a hugely delayed flight pay premium prices for a below average service they need to invest in their it systems and greatly up their game
  london to nice i agree totally with the comments made in michael croft's review today my flight to nice was cancelled as a result of the low notcost and unreliable it system that ba have while the senior management are likely celebrating somewhere that they managed to cut more costs the handling of the situation at heathrow was despicable and you  think that with all the failures that ba encounter these days they  have got this part of their act toher they make out such a problem is a bolt from the blue when clearly they have not been investing where they should instead focussing on cost cutting to boost their performance bonuses not just the ceo should go but some others at the top
  palma to london heathrow how does british-airways  away with having such a useless it system and presumably team of it staff / management these issues recur on such a frequent british-airwayssis it is now time for some heads to roll preferably from the ceo down just read a fatuously stupid interview with alex cruz talking about how his children are guiding him on the future of air travel when this man cannot manage to run the airline properly in 2019  not let al try to make himself look all eco notfriendly with such comments i have been a loyal customer for over 48 years and it seems that ba have not the slightest interest in those of us that pay full fares and have been through all the lows of ba without complaint until now my patience has run out 
  london city to ibiza disappointing all the flights were cancelled without explanation  not presumably because the striking staff did not turn up so trip was ruined got a replacement ticket for a different destination on a different week trip was british-airwayssic the meal consisted of two small shortbread biscuits british-airways is now firmly in the bucket airlines easily beaten by easyjet
  london to faro we booked our tickets family of 7 two months before the flight with british-airways so we could enjoy the quality and the service so we thought inbound flight seats has been booked and paid quite high amount for 7 seats for the row 2 and 3 outbound flight row 6 and 7 two weeks before the flight without any warnings and email from british-airways we've found out that our seats has been moved to unlucky 13 inbound and to a 8 outbound they've split all family quite far away apart from each other as well customer service has hang up on us for the first time and second ph call has promised to call british-airwaysck but never did will i ever over pay £2000 difference so i can have good customer service with british-airways ever again  not the answer is no  i am extremely upset that our seats has been given away to some else for no reason disappointed and you can no longer rely on british-airways
  calgary to london staff were not in high standards looked rushed and not polite did not look professional enough in our flight british-airwaysck to london staff were laughed and just chilled very loudly in british-airwaysck of the aircraft there was not welcome snacks we sat in the very last row and food choice ended only chicken was our option to have very sad and staff did not care about this situation
  london heathrow to sofia we checked in online so we went straight to british-airwaysggage drop it was quick and worked well our british-airwaysg was 25 kg maximum is 23 kg so we had to take 2 kg out after that we went to buy a neck cushion and we went to put our make up in british-airwaysgs show our passport and then go through to security my daughter was beeped but it was not a big deal it was fast and our flight was departing in 1h 30m we got some drinks and then we noticed our gate was announced early we headed to the gate and boarding began about 20m later boarding was fast and we were sitting in seats 33 def the seats were comfortable leather and had headrests a321 so there was no ife we had a 1 hour delay from the british-airwaysd airspace but eventually took off our route was a little different instead of going over france switzerland etc we went over germany hungary etc the food was good and was not too expensive we did not buy anything really just food while coming into bulgaria the views were nice the landing was pretty good despite the bump eventually we got off 1 hour late and we went home the verdict is that british-airways are pretty good despite the delay
  nice to kuwait via london my flight from nice was delayed in the plane for 2 hours and in delayed in heathrow for 5 hours when we finally left the plane there were no information on how i  another connecting flight since due to the delay i had to miss it then i had to pass through immigration which lasted for 2 hours there was no  at the desk just a piece of paper with a number that says for complaints call us now it was 3am with no  to speak too and i still do not have my british-airwaysgs i had to grab a taxi to sleep ba did not not provide a hotel stay i i then had to leave the apartment at 7 am to  to the next flight with kuwait airways
  buenos aires to london heathrow my wife and i flew british-airwaysck from argentina on my birthday and the trip was made memorable by an air hostess amelia who gave great service to every with her friendly professional manner on finding out it was my birthday she came british-airwaysck with a complimentary drink and personal birthday card the trip itself left on time and arrived in london early the aircraft was quite old but we found the seats relatively comfortable the entertainment is below standard especially the size of the screen 
  hong kong to london heathrow this is a long haul flight operated by boeing 777 not300er the seat especially the headrest is quite comfortable the legroom is large but there is a little metal box under the seat this negatively affects the legroom the films provided are not that many but i can see the flight path through the personal television they provide dinner and breakfast for me it is quite abundant but not very delicious
  what happened to a great airline got to heathrow 15 hours before flight and start queuing and at  point there were only 2 operators and then after 15 minutes a 3rd appeared 45 minutes later a ba guy asks for vegas travellers and then asks us to go tobritish-airways different line to rush things through there was 1 operator on this line and it took another 20 minutes waited over 1 hour on the tarmac as we has missed our slot due to late boarding got to las vegas and waited at british-airwaysggage claim for over 40 minutes no british-airwaysg got to ba desk to be told luggage missed plane and there should have been 2 members of staff at british-airwaysg claim to tell us no apology just a shrug of shoulders during day receive offers from ba to upgrade to club class and i try at least 10 times to book but website does not process speak to ba at 1st offer to be told offer finished despite the web advertising  through to manager who admits the ba website is the worst and advises to keep trying book in online for return and web accepts the 2 british-airwaysgs stated on web as 0 british-airwaysgs ring ba and they say go to airport and speak to a member of staff get vegas 3 hours early to make sure plenty of time to sort and find out there are no ba staff available in the whole airport until 2 hours before flight what a useless organisation i must state staff on plane very good
  london heathrow to malaga in business class full and very large club europe cabin on this morning flight held in the airbridge for 15 mins while boarding and not a word or reason as to why on boarding 2 cabin staff by entrance stood chatting amongst themselves and totally ignored customers  not not a great start usual cabin service except the staff were not the slightest bit interested in customer service and having paid a premium for business class realised it was such a waste of my the breakfast standards full english are about the same as a charter flight standard and despite what ba shout about this has g through some considerable cost cutting ba can perform well on a good day but it seems that cabin service is ting less consistent by the day  not are staff preparing to go on strike as well since that is the attitude they displayed male cabin staff was quite offensive to some arabic customers in front which was a shocker
  i was flying ba to delhi in economy because my original flight with swissair was cancelled the 777 aircraft is looking old the economy class seat is small and fairly cramped the inflight entertainment is shown on small screens films are ok the music selection is dire and make sure you bring your own noise cancelling headph and the food is just ok the flight did pretty much leave and arrive on time allowing for the rerouting around pakistani airspace 
  seattle to durbritish-airwaysn via london on 24th of july i arrived late just before departure time 1330hrs the shuttle bus picked me late from my hotel the british airways ladies who checked me advised me to rush because the plane was about to depart i rushed through the security thereby leaving my british-airwaysck pack which had all my documents when i was rushing british-airwaysck to the security i met the 2 lovely ladies who had checked me in and they asked me to go up with them to the plane because it was about to leave i panicked and they assured me that i will  my british-airwaysck pack in durbritish-airwaysn as i sat down in the plane another british airways hostess came and reassured me that i will  all my british-airwaysgs in durbritish-airwaysn on my arrival in durbritish-airwaysn i got all my british-airwaysgs including my british-airwaysck pack i  like to say thank you to the british-airways staff especially the 2 lovely ladies who checked me in its a pity i did not  their names i was panicky thank you so much
  london heathrow to austin 10 hour flight in a boeing 747 not400 noisy cabin tiny screens collapsing headrest chocolate on my seat selection of just a half dozen films and no wifi poor food with choices running out
  mykonos to london flight delayed and waiting to depart they are not on time be prepared to miss your connections take off 2 hours late the staff is some of the worst i have had on airlines you may be stuck on the runway and they wont offer you any water  the worst business class experience i have had 
 johannesburg to cape town return this flight was operated by comair and thus it was quite different from a normal british-airways flight in europe check in at the priority line was uneventful however on the return the guy at the counter did not know that oneworld sapphire could check in at the business class counter and kept on asking if i was flying business johannesburg airport and cape town's domestic terminal is laid out very similarly their lounge called slow is actually impressive although there was no full english on offer unlike the british-airways galleries lounges in other places there was a substantial amount of savoury snacks pastries and small bites they even had a coffee counter with made notto notorder drinks i assume later in the day this also becomes a british-airwaysr serving alcohol very impressive for a domestic business class lounge priority boarding was honoured and boarding was an orderly process i  recommend anybody wanting to  an extra legroom seat to reserve row 6 as there is actually tons of legroom in front i reserved an exit row and paid an extra £7 per exit row during the booking these seats were old and plush however i do prefer the newer leather seat used on their european aircraft as those offer better support i had also noticed during boarding that their business class had slightly larger seats in a 2x3 configuration i did not expect this as business class in europe is normally just a blocked middle seat there were several drink services on this two hour flight and a hot breakfast with either a british-airwayscon sausage and scrambled egg option or cheese omelette with veables option needless to say a hot meal on a two hour flight is very appreciated it was also rather tasty and tasted quite fresh the crew were very friendly making casual jokes and giving a down notto notearth friendliness you rarely  on airlines these days they were quite rushed but understandable due to the short flight time in cape town airport it was actually quite weird to see them use both an airbridge and stairs for passengers to deplane/board but since it took only 15 minutes to board a rather full 737 it works and makes sense i think that this flight has improved my opinion on british-airways and they were the same price as the competition south african airways i  be very curious on my next visit to see how the two of them compare given the fact that both are giving a near homologous product on africa's busiest air route for the price paid i'd be happy to fly them again
  grenada to gatwick having flown with ba on this aircraft type prior to refurbishment i was intrigued to experience the changes to the cabin the cabin was much smarter  not previous aircraft have looked very tired and the lighting was pleasant the entertainment system was hugely improved with a good selection of media on larger touch screen devices i suppose the reason i appreciated this was because the old systems were so hopelessly outdated but the family really found them entertaining for me the real issue was the tight leg room  not i am a slim 6ft 2'' and now the lack of seat width made it almost impossible to eat a meal it was for me very tight previously the seat format was 3 not3 not3 it is now 3 not4 not3 we were sat in the 4 outbound although on return we sat near the british-airwaysck of economy where the aircraft narrows and seats become 2 not4 not2 we sat in a 2 which was more bearable i also found the seat really hard after a couple of hours although sitting on the supplied british-airwaysck rest cushion helped a bit despite best efforts to sleep i failed i remember the old seats being more comfortable especially for long haul service was professional and timely and food was similar to previous flights  not edible in summary it seems a shame that ba have improved some aspects of the experience but seat comfort has been sacrificed which is a great pity
  prague to london a two hour flight on 27th july was delayed by 3 hours with no heads up given by ba there was no sympathy or compensation  especially as our original flight was early morning and with an email informing us of the delay we could have stayed longer in the hotel 
  london to dubritish-airwaysi lately i am frequently flying premium economy with british-airways the extra comfort compared to economy class is unparalleled the seat is way more comfortable attendants are really professional and very friendly if just could add the leg rest into all the other seats and not just the first row as it used to be in the old ba premium economy seats then it  be perfect that's my only note
  tel aviv to toronto via london the plane from london to toronto was run by air belgium the service from checkin until we received our cases here in israel was excellent the cabin staff on each airline were helpful and friendly the food was all acceptable for economy airline food and we had snacks and on 1 flight icecream was served soft drinks as well as wine and alcohol was plentiful for the people that asked and water was served all during each flight the planes had ample leg room and the seats were comfortable for economy class inflight entertainment was good enough there was something to watch on 4 flights i have not travelled british-airways for years but i will do again if the price is competitive as were these flights
  i flew yesterday from heathrow to manchester in business class from start to finish it was a shambles  i was sent to the wrong british-airwaysggage drop then to the wrong lounge i showed my boarding card and sent to the north lounge the furthest from the gate the boarding process was more like a rugby scrum no notice was taken of class of service and then my boarding card said assistance required so another queue was needed no explanation was given for this
  the first part from brussels to london heathrow was a fast flight however on the ground in london the problems started the gate where the arriving plane was planned to stop was not free what occurred in a waiting time on the ground for 40 minutes the captain constantly gave information and the entire team was friendly and courteous continental breakfast in business was ok for this short flight flight to larnaca was full embritish-airwaysrkation was prompt for business pax the team was very friendly the service started with a drink and some cookies  the meal was good despite a more substantial appetiser could be expected  not a few slices of green salad and  cherry tomato is a side dish not an appetiser it must be said the meal was an improvement since last year decent drinks and a good champagne were available followed by coffee or tea it is a longer flight  not a second round of drinks an hour before landing was maybe appropriated however it was not a problem to receive additional drinks
  stockholm to london worst business class flight i have flown split seating for myself and my wife because apparently they were overbooked the meal was inedible for me and was the worst airline meal i have been served 
 seems like no  was aware of my existence on the flight no drink no snack no bottle of water was offered no amenity kits when i asked they said n were left in stock they gave me toothpaste and a toothbrush which was ok and fast track invitation which was useless since no fast track is offered to british passports i was not given a menu i even had to ask for it i was not served the meal and they said it was because i was sleeping ok fine but even when i was awake no  bothered to ask me about the meal i had to ask for the menu a bottle of water and the meal and after all no apologies from the staff too many people are squeezed into business class even though i could lie down 180 degrees i had very little space at my seat given the very expensive fare i expected a much better service for business class passengers i'm very disappointed and will never use it again i wo not recommend british-airways business class to any
 premium economy dont waste your my on an overnight flight going out is acceptable but the night flight we had was a disgrace the food i use this term lightly wasnt fit for dogs on our flight it was salmon we think as it didnt taste of anything a meat of some kind but was too tough to stick a fork into let al eat it the veg tasted burnt bread roll was ok not really a saving grace one cup of tea or coffee at breakfast and dont bother asking what was in the box left on our table i didnt bother trying it the look on other peoples faces was good enough for me to know dont bother which in comparison to the outbound flight london to orlando was worlds apart greeted with a drink which was the first of many dinner was nice the steak edible veg cooked just right and dessert was nice with plenty of drinks inflight entertainment was good even though there was supposed to be wifi but couldnt log on so saved some my there i really thought this was going to be the best way to travel oh a broken seat for  of our party was a bit disappointing homeward bound and the inflight entertainment seem rather lacklustre which leads me to think it was an older plane but that really shouldnt happen what is not told when booking homeward flight on the top of your ticket if you have tsa pre you dont have to join the massive queue look for pre entered tsa line thats the  thats empty cause they tell no  about it
  lisbon to london business class is just economy class with an empty middle seat no leg room for me meal service had no choice by the time they got halfway through business class all that was left was cod freezing cold but no blankets poor staff spent most of the flight apologising never fly british-airways 
 heathrow to marseille within a few days of booking a flight for december ba advised flight has been changed to late evening arrival this is unacceptable so i opt to cancel and full refund ba then says it is refunding the fare and makes no mention of the fee i have paid for seat selection i have found a claim form for refund of these fees on submission they say they will take up to 28 days to think about it
 madrid to london with british-airways there is nothing left of business class on these flights when they bring the hot towel it feels like a british-airwaysd joke seats are the same as coach they took forever to hang my jacket after i asked in three occasions they gave me a sit that is considered a british-airwaysd coach seat without window see picture and on top of everything i find myself having to put my luggage just a british-airwaysckpack far behind my seat because they are choosing to bring the extra hand luggage that doesnt fit anymore in coach to business class ridiculous service so not worth the x25 cost that a business class ticket goes for feel totally ripped off
  gatwick to glasgow awful experience our flight arrived over 2 hours late at 850pm so late our car rental company was closed and we were stuck at the airport without our car we had to pay for a taxi to our hotel and british-airwaysck to the airport the next day which was really expensive our new car hire was three times the price since it was last minute british-airways  not help compensate because they said it wasnt their fault
  frankfurt to london ba staff watched while security went through partner's british-airwaysg for around 30 mins it required a call to police who sauntered up and stared at the british-airwaysg for a while  not actually just clothes when they were finishing the flight dispatcher closed the flight only 1 not2 minutes required much longer spent unloading my luggage we had checked this british-airwaysg in almost 2 hours previously and arrived at security in plenty of time
❎  london to olbia complete confusion the plane was delayed ting to sardinia and so we waited: but following check notin at sardinia we were penned into long lines no seats extreme heat and no water in the queues the airport staff in sardinia appeared to be overwhelmed finally got onto the plane and were now delayed on the tarmac we are due to depart more than 3 hours after our scheduled departure time but so far still stuck on the tarmac with few updates no water provided i felt unwell but was told they had no glasses so nothing to drink numerous small children with no hydration and high temperatures after a second time of asking i was told i could buy a drink once we took off but they have no idea when that  be they need to abritish-airwaysndon the flight at this stage before more people become unwell cabin crew just standing there doing nothing but looking perplexed
  rotterdam to london city after waiting for 6 hours at rotterdam airport delays i was told they re notrouted my flight to amsterdam and that i needed to quickly catch a taxi that i have to pay for from rotterdam to amsterdam airport in the hope of catching the flight from there as i worried i nt make it i asked to be put in a hotel & fly the following morning but they said that was not an option as all fights are booked there was no apology no offer of a bus or taxis to those re notrouted to amsterdam and throughout the process & long queue no  bothered to explain to us what was happening had i known wed be re notrouted to amsterdam i ve left rotterdam earlier rather than wait in a long queue just to he told that info at the end what a waste of time energy & my and no apology to make up for the hours or delay its quite unbelievable 
  return flight to dublin outbound galleries north fine and good breakfast flight was fine return flight was delayed by 40 mins gate staff kept us informed lounge at dublin was generic lounge but was ok staff on both flights fine return aircraft quite new and well presented
  barbritish-airwaysdos to gatwick we boarded a half full flight and whilst preparing for take off the video was shown as normal the crew participation side of it seemed like trouble to the crew once inflight the drinks service got under way and service was very quick i had a beer and my partner a soft drink i was given a room temperature can and no drinking vessel and my partner her soft drink and the standard plastic cup no mention of ice within 20 minutes the meal service commenced they got to our seats which were 3 from the british-airwaysck of the aircraft and when we were served two trays appeared and passed to us i enquired what the meal was and we were both told pasta its all we have left every else had a choice of chicken or pasta my partner refused her pasta and i proceeded to challenge why on a half filled flight they had run out no tangible answer came british-airwaysck but was very rudely told she   chicken from premium economy i said only  was required as i  eat the pasta glad i did i think chicken was placed on my partners tray it was burnt during this service no further drinks were offered except for water trays were gathered and that was the last we saw of the crew for 4 hours they reappeared about 70 minutes before landing served a box containing stale bread with processed cheese and a stale cake i politely refused the offering and my partner ate the bread tea and coffee was served  our flight out 7 days previously was the exact opposite pleasant staff food standard but acceptable the only other negative was the musical chairs played by fellow passengers the crew turned a blind eye the positives the ife has a wide choice and we got home safely and ting off the aircraft was a pleasure as it was also the coldest flights i have ever been on
  i  like to praise the outstanding courtesy and service i received from the ba cabin crew members during my flight ba0011 from london heathrow to singapore on 25 june the cabin crew were both friendly and attentive to their passengers needs enabling them to relax & enjoy their flight i feel very proud that british-airways continue to train their staff to such a very high standard it really is a privilege to fly british-airways
 madrid to london heathrow this was my second trip madrid to london on british-airways since may on this trip like the previous the plane broke down and we waited 25 hours on the plane for it to be repaired whilst the temperature outside was 42 degrees the cabin crew director offered passengers the opportunity to purchase water and other cold drinks from the british-airwaysr only ba could try to make my out of  of its technical failures i then waited another hour to pick up my suitcase as i'm a silver card holder i could access their business lounge in madrid i regret using it fortunately this was my last ever trip on ba
 ba762 heathrow to oslo i have flown with ba a few times in the last few months i have came off medication which makes me more nervous flying on planes i had notified the cabin crew and they were hstly so amazing and went above and beyond for me they had gave me a free bottle of water kept asking if i was okay put their arm around me made me feel so much better the flight was super smooth and overall an amazing service thanks again ba and i will be flying again with you soon
 hamburg to abu dhabi via london heathrow initial flight from heathrow to abu dhabi was cancelled had to fly a day earlier as flights on following days were cancelled as well service with not a free glass of water on the first leg abu dhabi to london delayed by over 3hrs a generous dirham 20 voucher £38 received from ba which was enough for a bottle of water or a coffee 
 new york to glasgow via london a routine and smooth overnight flight that departed the gate about 45 minutes late because of a security issue at the terminal #7 i had an electronic boarding pass on the ba app but an announcement was made that we needed to  paper versions there was a separate desk where a couple of agents performed this task the pilot introduced the flight attendants as “gorgeous”  not which came across to me as inappropriate i  have preferred efficient or even helpful to describe them i had an aisle seat in a 3 not3 not3 seat layout the middle seat was unoccupied enough leg space and storage space overhead a good collection of all sorts of movies with free headphs provided the ife system was easy to use a drink service preceded the meal service i asked for a beer and was cheerfully offered their centenary year specially brewed ipa brewdog speedbird 100 sensing that i might not enjoy it the attendant also gave me a heineken and a bottle of wine to accompany the dinner that followed soon thereafter the entree choices were chicken and pasta i chose the later very british-airwayssic food tea and coffee followed before landing a sandwich and a drink was served i could not figure out what was in the sandwich the british-airwaysthroom was clean blankets and pillows were on every seat alighting was quick landing cards have been d away with for the fare i paid i was satisfied  not no complaints i connected to a domestic flight to glasgow the announcement of the gate was made quite late newspapers were available at the gate  not a worthy amenity it was a smooth flight in a 3 not3 seating i was in an aisle seat the next to me was empty no complimentary food or drink on this segment the two flight attendants once the plane reached cruising altitude put on aprons and pushed a cart down the aisle hawking edibles and elixirs the pilot introduced them as gorgeous both on this and the earlier flight a video presentation showed off the safety instructions it was supposed to be funny and engaging i felt it was neither  not the accents of the actors were hard to understand the flight landed on time overall a positive experience but next time i will look into a non notstop flight to glasgow from new york the transfer at heathrow is anxiety notinducing
 london heathrow to new york the staff went above and beyond to make sure we had a wonderful experience refreshing to see these days the quality of food and drinks was wonderful there was plenty of leg room as well we  definitely fly again with ba and are planning on making this our only airline if it flies to all of my destinations on departure my tv did not work they tried twice to reset it for me however this did not work that was fine i resolved to reading my book just before landing our flight attendant who had be looking after us asked if it had been rectified i replied no but it was ok she came british-airwaysck with a bottle of champagne a pair of pyjamas and a makeup british-airwaysg full of goodies not just for me but for my sister as well to say i was overwhelmed was an understatement all i can say is thank you british-airways from the bottom of my heart the trip was for my birthday and you certainly made it something special
  gatwick to bermuda boarded very quickly and on time seating area smart appearance much better than the old aircraft that normally turn up service very good food was the best i have had from ba new crockery added to the good feel and appearance long overdue duvet and bedding much better and what you expect for this high notcost route the pillow is fabulous g are the small pillows and we now have a luxurious pillow you want to use 10/10 for this flight and the crew even though it was full up front i hope this is a turning point for british-airways thank you i am looking forward to my seychelles flight in october and my rio flight in december keep it coming
  london heathrow to larnaca perfect the early morning departure meant that terminal 5 was unusually quiet the galleries lounge offered a wide range of food and drinks in a pleasant environment the flight took off and landed on time the cabin crew were incredibly attentive and provided a very professional and pleasant onboard experience arrival procedures at larnaca were incredibly efficient we completed immigration and picked up our hold british-airwaysggage within 30 minutes of arriving at the gate all in all a very enjoyable trip
  ba 2616 and 2617 return trip from gatwick to cagliari both flights on a saturday and were full aircraft was an a320 not200 on both legs sat in row 7 outbound 2 rows behind club europe sat in row 25 on the return leg room seemed tighter than row 7 the brown leather seating suggested that the aircraft may have been in the bmi fleet didnt bother with the new m&s on board service outward but did on the return the m&s sandwich was everything you  expect from an m&s sandwich apart from the cost but the coffee i had and the tea my wife had were below standard it also took the 2 cabin crew the best part of 75 minutes to  from row 6 to row 25 the other 2 members of the cabin crew appeared to hide in club europe attending to just 10 passengers despite quite a lot of turbulence and the seat belt sign on for about 30 minutes they continued to serve hot drinks and passengers were advised to be careful you are now given a cup of hot water to add your coffee or tea british-airwaysg to also a queue of 7 or 8 passengers requiring the toilet also formed behind the trolley and they  not return to their seats the rubbish from the trolley service was collected by hand as we were preparing to land outbound flight was fine inbound flight was not a great advertisement for ba perhaps standards at lgw are not as good as at lhr
  heathrow to kalamata heathrow t5 to kalamata greece 8th june and return 1 week later used avios points to upgrade to exit row seats for more legroom bad news  not took off 1 1/2 hours late from heathrow delays to previous incoming flight but made up about 1/2 hour on the journey out also left kalamata about 1/2 hour late on our return but landed virtually on time seats much more comfortable with more padding than for example ryanair or jet2com so with the extra legroom the flights were pretty comfortable expensive or course m&s offerings for food but tasty enough pleasant fa's so all in all decent flights have not used ba for short haul for quite a few years but  use again if the price was right
  london to gothenburg unique procedures that are not adding any order but create a lot of mess extra visa checks passport checks separate queues additional controls heathrow terminal 5 is the most bizarre
  amsterdam to london on 15th april i arrived 3 hours before flight where i waited in line for an hour while staff attended to checking people in a what seemed like a turtle paced snail like sense of urgency after that rather lengthy delaywhen i got to the gate on time i was told the gate was shut thinking it must have been some kind of joke i noted with the british-airways representatives saying that i was on time she replied yes but you were the last person every had made it before me my british-airwaysgs were already offloaded she continued to say  after asking what do i do now not having the ability to ring abroad i asked if they could help me which they replied saying there is no qantas office in amsterdam and they cannot help me 
  istanbul to london my first flight in economy is the new a321 neo the aircraft is set up with the first 15 rows of regular seats and the remaining 17 rows of the new extra slim economy seats the seat does not recline is very thin and ok for an hour flight however 3 hours 45 minutes flight it became pretty uncomfortable after 2 hours the 5 members of the cabin crew were great serving the usual ms for sale products
  i had some difficulty from the start after my initial booking the website repeatedly asked me to log in even though i was already logged in i wanted to reserve seats and request special meals it took me 2 days to achive this i was amazed by the cost of reserving ordinary seats no extra legroom this bumped the price up for 4 people by £328 and seats were only booked on the lhr notkul and return kul notlhr legs i had difficulty checking in using the ba app and eventually did it using malaysia airlines app checking in online was only allowed 24hrs before making things a little awkward being in kuching for our return leg with an 8 hr time difference i was looking forward to flying on the boeing 787 but it really is just a dream food choices we were told ran out at breakfast the choice was full english or just an omelette but the full english ran out or so we were told but looking over my shoulder a few minutes later and another trolley had appeared with the full english on it earlier meals were ok with beer wine and other drinks available there was very little attention by cabin crew between main meals and we had to go to the rear galley to ask for water for an over 12h flight i think the cabin should at least be visited 2 not3 times toilets were clean and worked ok and the aircraft as a whole was clean and tidy the ife selection was superb with many of the latest films available along with games and music our return flight from kl to london was very cold the boeing 787 has no way of changing the airflow to your seat
  london to dusseldorf no free drinks or food which is pretty normal for short haul flights crew was pretty average seat was average ground crew was pretty nice no inflight entertainment 
 london to seoul nightmare experience with british-airways almost constantly my business cabin is downgraded to economy at the last minute with a 12 hours long nothauls flight lounge simy sucks cheap noisy and croweed multiple malfunction items on the aircraft including unfolded table given the price it charge certainly  of the worst airlines  can possible take
  london to vancouver economy was a lot more cramped than i expected ba had crammed seats in crew were okay food reasonable really although i had upgraded my food which came before every else had theirs which was a shame flew british-airwaysck premium class more room i probritish-airwaysbly wont use them in november when i go british-airwaysck timing was good and air quality felt ok as i didnt  a headache
❎  newcastle to delhi via london at check notin  i was charged for carrying 28 kilos extra which is of no problem i paid a total of £65 for 28 kilos on my flight from london to delhi during boarding i asked for water to which the attendant told she   but she was busy as customers were boarding the flight i then  asked for a bottle of water  which she seemed to for  2 hours into the  journey my in notflight entertainment system got stuck on the tv and radio feature when the dinner was served ithe meal consisted of chicken gravy and mash along with bread butter and a mousse delays caused by british-airways resulted in the flight reaching delhi late and me missing my connecting flight but as i landed at delhi and picked my british-airwaysggage from the belt a british-airways staff was ready with another ticket from delhi to mumbritish-airwaysi without me even asking 
  miami to delhi via london  the ba business class i flew for the first time recently was the worst i have  flown whereas most have four seats across british-airways has eight the lay down beds are hard thin and short not worth the my
  london to sydney via singapore checked in with a british-airwaysg which was 234kg my allowance was 23kg i was made to repackage the british-airwaysg and take two pairs of shoes out and place them in my hand luggage really i found the food on both legs of the flight horrible
  phoenix to amsterdam via london it was 10 hrs on a delayed flight in a cramped seat with no lights no call light no entertainment of any sort and food i found exceptionally british-airwaysd the b747 that was terribly maintained the offer of 20gbp for compensation is insulting and further exemplifies a lack of concern for your passengers comfort and safety
  standard run of the mill airline for today's economy flew tel aviv to new york with a two hour layover in london heathrow crew was fine entertainment system on the london to new york leg was very nice the special meal i ordered was not on either of the two flights i  called them two and a half weeks prior to departure to check that the meals were in the system and was assured they were i submitted a complaint to british-airwayscom and the responses i received were lame and unacceptable not a stitch of good will was forthcoming from british-airways as i suggested topping off my avios british-airwayslance to a mere 5000 points my british-airwayslance is around 3500 
  belfast city to atlanta via london heathrow t5 check notin was fairly smooth at belfast as it was early in the morning however when the agent called me over the check me in he was all flustered that i was not an elite executive club member although my boyfriend had just checked in with the same agent without any difficulty i knew he was working the premium line but nobody was standing in it and i was standing in the regular line when he called me after about 20 minutes i finally got a boarding pass to go through security the flight from bhd to lhr was uneventful and british-airwaysre notbs as nothing was served for free on the flight my boyfriend therefore hated it as we're used to ting better service on american in the us but i was fully aware that ba had turned itself into a glorified easyjet once we arrived to lhr i continued by myself to atlanta on ba and was shocked at the crowded user notunfriendly t5 although i suppose it was pretty in some ways i had to sit in  of the dank cattle pits they hold people in until their flight is called so it felt very crowded and hot after my flight was called i found myself on a crowded shuttle to the plane with pushy people boarding was straightforward however and the flight attendants were very polite and helpful to customers even in economy the flight product was just ok in my view i had an exit row aisle seat and while i had extra room and a nice headrest the seat was right by the lav so it stank ife was fine with a decent selection but it was not as complete as delta's the food was the bland equivalent of what delta serves so no brownie points there and the tea service they had was terrible: we were given half notsandwiches in plastic wrap without a tray and then only with a limited selection of beverages i remember years ago when ba was a premium carrier and served very nice things to its passengers with a friendly smile those smiles have disappeared for the most part and the feeling of flying a special carrier is no longer there however i arrived on time and promptly got my british-airwaysg the 777 was also nice and spacious and the flight attendants were polite so i might fly them again though i  not recommend ba due to the crowds and discomfort i experienced at t5
  buenos aires to london i wish to thank the crew that was so nice to me while i was terribly sick wish i knew their names they gave me medicine a blanket and caressed my british-airwaysck while i was crying from the stomach ache forever grateful
  london to nashville the worst airline trans notatlantic despite looking forward to flying on this new route to nashville british-airways ruined this trip the flight was delayed by over three hours whilst they ostensibly replaced the damaged aircraft with an inbound boeing 787 not9 from san jose the airplane was filthy dirty in club class which is british-airwaysd enough having to suffer the awful dated club class ying notyang facing narrow seats with divider business class on british-airways is the worst of any airline the wifi was out of service on late arrival in nashville my luggage arrived soaking wet and i was unable to change clothes on my return to the uk i contacted british-airways customer relations to seek compensation and got the usual pathetic mainly computer generated insincere apology i am now forced to haggle with british-airways and endure their woeful so notcalled customer relations department it is a real shame to witness the decline of this national carrier british-airways treat their premium class customers with contempt this is what happens when an airline has a monopoly from heathrow 
  flight was delayed by almost two hours and it was nice when they gave us the only boeing 747 not400 that was in old boac retro colours the seats where wide and comfortable plenty of storage the ife was average food was good and in generous portions but what stood out was the high level of service and friendliness
 just checked in for a flight from newcastle with ba the check in process was disgusting 45 minutes queuing 2 ba staff working in two desks  of which was a virtually empty priority queue in which the female checking assistant spent a large proportion of her time chatting to a colleague from air france in the adjacent desk the process was ridiculously slow with each check in taking several minutes when the priority queue representative deigned to check economy passengers she seemed to take an eternity in the 45 minutes it took us the queue never dropped below about 100 people i have never queued in a slower or more disorganised check in desk the adjacent jet2 desks had seven staffed desks and i counted 14 staff the “welcome” sign displayed at the ba desk should have been located at the start of the queue with the additional wording of “youre in for a long wait” to cap it all after enduring the queue were now delayed 40 minutes thus far so unprofessional
  gatwick to madrid when i arrived i waited for  and a half hours for my  suitcase it didnt arrive  i was asked to fill in a ‘lost luggage form which i did and given a number to call the next day the representative said shed make sure the suitcase was delivered by 500 pm i was out during the day when i returned later that evening there was no suitcase it hadnt been delivered the next morning sunday i phd the number again the answer message said ph british-airwaysck on monday as i was leaving on sunday night this was pointless i was leaving madrid at 830 pm my  suitcase arrived two hours before i left madrid so i spent the whole time in madrid without my medicines change of clothes toiletries etc which ended up wasting a lot of my short valuable time buying essentials that i needed whilst there
  my boyfriend and i wanted to return from our trip to london a day early but the ba app and website continued to glitch so i called to ask how much it  be to leave a day earlier i was told that the penalty fee for changing the flight is $275 each and theres a $50 fee for them to do it over the ph thats $600 and the price of a flight by itself we decided to try our luck again changing it on the app and paid $550 to change our flight to  day earlier to make it british-airwaysck for an event the flight was delayed and arrived 1hr 55 mins late we missed our event the plane was filthy and my tv didnt work i asked the flight attendant for something to clean the slimy finger smears off the screen with and she told me its normal wear and tear but i could  toilet paper from the british-airwaysthroom i called to ask for a refund for the fees since the flight was delayed but they told me they cant give us a refund because we got on the flight
  i had kept my laptop british-airwaysg in the overhead cabin somebody got in a bigger cabin british-airwaysg and they could not fit the british-airwaysg in the space remaining so they kept the british-airwaysg on my laptop british-airwaysg when i asked the flight attendant to help me with this he asked me to keep my luggage down  i was travelling with only  laptop british-airwaysg placed it in the cabin right over my seat and instead of asking the oversized british-airwaysg to be placed properly or kept it elsewhere my british-airwaysg which was in place before the oversized british-airwaysg came in was asked to be moved out how fair is this 
  london to delhi a truly first class experience from check in to landing i am a frequent flyer with ba and have not always had an amazing experience this  was check in was easy and swift and the concorde room was excellent the flight itself was wonderful while i accept it isnt the best first class cabin in the skies the service is second to n the cabin crew were friendly greeting us by name and showing us personally to our seats throughout they ensured we were very well looked after without them being overbearing new soft product is very good and food definitely much improved 
  london heathrow to dubritish-airwaysi last sunday we unfortunately missed our ba flight to dubritish-airwaysi due to unforeseen circumstances so we booked the next available flight for the morning which was with emirates today we arrived at dubritish-airwaysi airport expecting to board the flight home that we had already paid for months in advance at check in the ba staff told us that our flight had been cancelled as we missed our outgoing flight we have not received a refund for the seats and they have refused to refund us the tickets we had brought 
  london to seattle my husbritish-airwaysnd and i have used this service for a number of years as our son lives in america we have always been very satisfied with the service unfortunately i was taken ill on this flight and the service went from good to superb id like to thank the cabin crew and captain for the care i received during the last two hours of the flight advice was sought via radio i was made comfortable in the galley at least  crew member with me at all times given oxygen etc paramedic boarded the plane and escorted me off when i was then given a thorough medical check a wheel chair was waiting and we were fast tracked through customs as i was not well enough to walk to the car park we met the crew at the lift and the captain came to ask how i was many thanks to all of the and apologies to passengers that i must have disturbed
  johannesburg to london i booked a seat without luggage firstly  cannot make  booking for two passengers if only  has luggage this caused an issue when trying to seat toher when the passenger without luggage tried to move seats normally a free option for standard seats you  advised that you have to pay this was not disclosed when the booking was made it was irritating because  of us was ill 
  london to milan evening outbound flight with some on board space so middle seat was empty boarding by group number worked effectively and i was able to store my laptop in the overhead free newspapers were available in the jet way passengers were warmly greeted i was  row behind emergency exit and despite numerous requests from the steward woman in front was very challenging in agreeing to have her british-airwaysg stored in the overhead which the steward handled very politely and patiently usual on board trolley service which i did not use flight departed 10 minutes late due to lengthy taxi way and due to a head wind arrived in linate 20 minutes late return flight could have been a challenge due to italian strike but the very full flight departed on time and landed 15 minutes early the cabin crew on this flight were excellent especially the senior stewardess who was warm and friendly towards every single customer  not outstanding we were taken off the aircraft and bussed into t5 which i think actually saved time as the entrance is directly below passport control all in all a couple of very good flights
  the connecting flight to johannesburg was on an older 737 not400 with proper business class seats and lots of legroom pre nottake off drinks offered and a decent meal for a short flight everything went smoothly and service was good boarding for the main flight was on time and proceeded smoothly we were seated on the upper deck in the forward cabin much has been said about the ba ying notyang seat configuration the seats are narrow and there is a lack of privacy for the aisle seat with probritish-airwaysbly the main complaint being lack of storage for personal items around the seat however the seat is very comfortable in any position and the white company bedding is excellent we had an aisle / centre seats at the rear of the cabin which worked well as a couple with the privacy screen left down the centre seat does have a shelf for personal belongings and access from this seat does not require stepping over another passenger the service on this flight was superb from the welcome on boarding and continuing throughout the flight  not very efficient quick to respond and super friendly preflight champagne or fruit juice was offered as soon as we were seated with a british-airwaysr service as soon as the seat belt light was off there was a choice of 4 starters 3 mains and 3 sweets or cheeseboard with a decent choice of wines breakfast offered a good choice although we were happy with just the fruit yoghurt and bread there could be no complaints in respect of catering the a380 is a super aircraft and very quiet but without doubt the major feature of this flight was the fantastic crew our connecting flight to leeds was good but compared with our south african flight it was noticeable that this was economy class seats and spacing with just an empty middle seat it is a short flight but there was still a full meal service the only poor aspect on this trip was arrival in leeds the airport seems quite run notdown escalator not working and few staff to be seen there was only  other arrival but we still waited over 30 minutes for luggage to come through
 london heathrow to los angeles very nice experience i read other reviews slamming ba but that was not the experience we had from the check in to the lounge and on board the flight our experience was fantastic crew on the flight was outstanding and very attentive food was good not great but very good seats worked well and comfy more on that in the seat review again the flight crew and make or break the experience and this crew hit a home run in flight entertainment worked well but was not streaming with i like over the monitors aa does a very good job on this one world route as well but i  take ba over aa if you can but both airlines do a good job on these longer hauls
 cpt is definitely ting its act toher: ba's galleries lounge is spacious with a good selection of food and staff actually managed to make the group boarding work for once the upper deck is still  of the better bets when flying in club world that's despite the ancient yin/yang seats and the tiny ife screen with appalling resolution the new bedding certainly helps cushion the hard seats and the large pillow actually feels luxurious the dinner service was according to the new cw 'soft' design which meant delays while plates were brought out to passengers individually on the whole i think it works and having the 'triple bread' roll already on the tray means that the bread is there when you want it rather than served with the dessert breakfast has been streamlined too and staff actually paid attention to the request cards filled in before takeoff apart from some inevitable turbulence the flight went according to plan and we touched down 30 minutes ahead of schedule a good flight overall but an old style business class experience
  sofia to belfast via london the legroom on the sofia to heathrow flight was terrible i am not tall but my knees were pushing against the seat in front  service was non existent unless you want to pay inflated prices where did the service go there was a british-airwaysd delay on the belfast flight  we were not allowed to re notenter the lounge when the plane developed a fault as we had g through security  only after 40 minutes were we allowed to re notenter the lounge service announcement was chaotic and contradicted what ba was sending us via texts the delay lasted 2 hours 55 minutes just short enough to avoid compensation the belfast flight had a lot more legroom than the 3 nothour flight from sofia  i will never set foot on this airline again 
  lima to gatwick helpful and courteous cabin crew  the seat was uncomfortable and the in flight entertainment system derisory the screen was small and in poor condition movies shown in the in flight magazine were unavailable and the selection of movies was poor the touch screen failed to respond correctly and at times occasionally without warning increased the sound level to maximum without touching the screen or handset a 12 hr flight with a rubbish entertainment system
 inverness to auckland via singapore with british-airways service was very good but comfort was very british-airwaysd for a 14 hour i had no more leg room than i did for an hour flight i was uncomfortable and as a regular flyer i have used other airlines that provide much more space for long haul flights
 i was seated right next to the galley and lavatory in the aisle during the safety talk the cabin crew were only metres away talking loudly which was irritating so my initial impression was disappointed for business class however into the flight i found  female crew very personable and was offered a seat two british-airwaysck i was not provided with a complimentary travel wallet so did not realise that socks and sleep mask were available and i needed to ask for a pillow the menu guide was on cheap paper and with no convenient place to store it for reference later was very ordinary the evening meal was acceptable soup steak/veg fruits  was ok served with freezing cold cutlery bed was ok but nowhere to store spectacles or personal needs such as spectacles asthma puffer or water bottle the breakfast of juice and cereal/yoghurt was fine but the single poached egg was like a rubber british-airwaysll and the included fish patties were unpalatable the lavatory was spacious and allowed room to change clothes ready for the connecting flight overall i expected a better level of attention to detail and a more upmarket delivery the only business class addition feature that i appreciated was being able to stretch out for some sleep ba ground staff were unable to link my second flight on a qf 11 from singapore to brisbritish-airwaysne insisting i needed to collect my luggage leave arrivals and recheck in for next flight i am 73 with some mobility problems requiring assistance so this was a worry for me when i arrived in singapore the kind assistance girl arranged to take me to a special transit desk where it was no problem arranging for my british-airwaysgs to be forwarded to next flight
  flight was ok minor delay did not both me what was astonishing is that we had to wait an hour or so to drop off our luggage because at lyon airport they were training new ground staff at the same time they continued doing this even though the cue became pretty huge and time started to run out to make it to the flight
"  
gatwick to barbritish-airwaysdos return i normally travel on ba with low expectations with the result that i am not too disappointed and sometimes pleasantly surprised the outbound flight was about par for the course with a reasonably comfortable seat and an ok cabin crew that did just about enough to look after us and make the flight uneventful however the flight did leave british-airwaysng on time and managed to land in barbritish-airwaysdos before the virgin flight that was scheduled to leave gatwick five minutes before us with the result that we got through arrivals quickly the return flight a week later managed to reinforce my low expectations of ba with  of the poorer flights that we have experienced over the last few years once again when you travel west to east the crew specifically  lady who was looking after our part of the cabin somehow feel they have to rush through every part of the drinks and meal service that it becomes an ordeal the pre departure drinks were missed on all of seats on the left hand side of the pe cabin not a big deal but irritating non the less no bread was served with dinner despite there being butter on the plate so i presume it was missed my wife had ordered a veggie meal and was served about ten minutes before every else which was fine however as the crew were serving the remaining meals there was a continual dialogue across the two aisles about what selections they each had on their respective trolleys when they reached our row they somehow thought it  be a good idea to try and pass a hot tray of chicken in gravy across the four middle seats with the result that the red hot gravy spilled on the my wife's remaining food and lap although fortunately she did have a napkin in place which absorbed most of the liquid it also spilled on my kindle which thankfully had the cover closed a very brief apology was given but without any sincerity and i suspect blissfully unaware of the obvious mistake they had made my wife's wine was replaced but not the rest of her dinner once again we landed on time which was a good thing overall the return flight was extremely poor"
  marseille to london i am generally annoyed with the quality of the service i believe that we should not have to pay for a glass of water with slice of lemon in a ba flight i realised that i forgot a big duty free british-airwaysg in the plane after the passport control i went to the ba helpdesk the staff sent me to terminal 5 at the lost and found to pick up my british-airwaysg while it was not even there luckily i decided to stop on the way in the lost and found of terminal 3 where they the friendly lost and found staff and not the ba staff nicely explained me that there was no point for me to go there and called some other agents to help me 
  the cabin crew on flight ba035 london to chennai were very efficient and did their best to take care of their clients i did tell them i  write a review and here it is keep up the good service and thanks
  gatwick to malaga check in was fairly quick the check in area at gatwick is quite nice although they are failing with general upkeep the whole area needed vacuuming and there were stains and signs of chewing gum on the carpets if youre not going to look after it then you better just having normal airport flooring the lounge at gatwick is really nice and whilst it was very busy there were still available comfy and desk style chairs to suit the food and drink offering was very good tasty and varied on board i was lucky to be able to book the exit row which actually makes the seats better than club in my opinion food and drinks service was fairly slow although being near the front this wasnt a problem for me the food offering is fairly poor really a couple of sandwiches or snacks drinks selection is better what was very nice was near the end of the flight i was given a free glass of champagne for being a silver member i nt expect this and im sure its just because they had a bottle to use up but it was a nice gesture to show to frequent flyers still no wifi or wifi british-airwayssed in flight entertainment offered priority british-airwaysg tags as usual are kind of irrelevant my british-airwaysg took quite a long time to come through and was preceded by dozens of non priority british-airwaysgs overall a decent flight and very good value as i paid using avios being silver and ting lounge access and free seat selection was a massive plus
  boston to london heathrow was excited to experience a380 for the first time paid a steep $91 for the seat selection on the upper deck was very comfortable with storage cabin beneath the window seat itself was the standard  comfortable the boarding was efficiently managed for such a large aircraft there was never a massive crowd in front of the gate the inflight service for the outbound leg was less than ideal the food was very mediocre at best  not not worth losing sleep over it there was serious bumps along the way midflight the a380 being so massive easily absorbed it return was on a b777  not flight was not full but almost full the inflight service and the food served were both remarkably better than the outbound journey the british-airwaysggage drop area however was a disaster n of the machines worked and there was single kind hearted person assisting passengers the boarding was again very orderly both outbound and inbound ife was good but not as good as some long haul carriers if both legs had similar cabin crew and food i  have scored them higher 
  london to cape town in first and our first taste of the new 'soft' product still unfortunately a 30 year notold 747 that had not had its refurbishment and was showing its age a wardrobe door that's falling off its hinges a non nottouch touch screen and a cupboard door in the washroom that wo not stay shut do not pass muster in first and blemish the impression of the positive changes in the on notboard service the young mixed fleet crew did a reasonable job and served drinks and food efficiently without the wait other reviewers have complained about care was also taken in preparing and plating up the food for once nothing was overcooked and even the beef was decent bedding is also improved with a good quality duvet and large pillow the ife remains the same low notres screen quality and the new headphs are uncomfortable worn for more than the duration of a single film the goodies british-airwaysg is much better and worth taking home overall a pretty good flight but it remains to be seen what ba will do with its long notin notthe nottooth first class when their new club suites are launched
  this review is specifically aimed at the excellent cabin crew on ba 174 from jfk new york to heathrow on tue 14th may i was travelling british-airwaysck from new york following a few days break with 11 girlfriends check in and boarding was all on schedulehowever it was identified that there was a technical problem and the captain advised passengers that some assistance was required to rectify the issue; this resulted in over an hour's delay leaving ny despite this annoying delay the cabin crew more than made up for this they were friendly polite and could not do enough to ensure our journey was comfortable and enjoyable they were all exceptional even those that were not serving in the section i was in i do hope that this information is passed on
  london to aberdeen before boarding the flight i was forced to check in my british-airwaysg at the gate because apparently the flight was full and i was boarding in group 5 i was traveling with the permitted allowance and discussed with the lady at the boarding gate i saw people boarding with tax free british-airwaysgs on top of the other british-airwaysgs being almost the last on the plane there was free spaces to accommodate british-airwaysgs i was not happy because i had the permitted allowance 
  gatwick to dubrovnik overcrowded lounges business class seats same as economy with middle seat empty lgw lounge opens  hr before some eu flights in morning only and met by a large queue and now frequent flyers dont  free british-airwaysggage anymore on long haul cheap tickets
  i paid an extra £500 for two premium economy seats on this long haul flight and was very disappointed the seat felt small and was shabby the tv screen was small and very dark i tried to adjust it but it was still unwatchable the whole experience was very poor not premium in any way the return flight was a code share with japan airines which was premium a whole different experience i  be happy to pay for their premium seats i  advise avoid british-airways premium economy as it is far from premium i felt a complete waste of £500
  faro to heathrow flight was very good no issues at all but yet again british-airwaysggage collection was a disaster we fly club or first all the time and without fail the british-airwaysggage is always last off spoke to ba desk and they were clueless and had no idea why this happens or how to stop it and correct it same happened on flight out too it is a shambles and a disgrace waited 39 mins got cases at heathrow and this is unacceptable will kit be using them again avoid at all costs
 vancouver to london an excellent flight on ba i travel this route several times a year and generally ba are much better than ac especially on this flight ba were way ahead of the competition seats comfortable food pretty good for economy decent wine and the in flight crew simply outstanding professional smiling friendly they embodied ba at their very best
  gatwick to tenerife all so wrong lounge really overcrowded / food on the plane pretty horrid left most of it paid for and travelling business class and allocated four rows away from my partner  this is normal procedure apparently on top of a £2000 six night holiday i should have paid another hundred pounds plus to sit with my partner  not total madness this is an airline with a self destruct button such a shamehave just booked norwegian for our next flights to barcelona and buenos aires did not even bother to look at ba
 washington to london having travelled out to washington from heathrow on 23/04/19 first class i was not overly impressed although the concorde room was relaxing and comfortable the british-airwaysr staff were a mixture of attentive and somewhat dismissive the cabin crew were polite but quite surgical in their manner which gave an overall impression of a cold and clinical approach my return journey could not have been more different the ba lounge was very well presented with a fantastic choice of both food and drink but the hi notlight of my return flight were the engaging nature of the cabin crew nothing short of amazing i was offered the usual amenities upon boarding but what set this flight apart from the start was the very happy and friendly nature of the crew absolutely nothing was too much trouble and they took the time to chat with me and showed a real general interest in what we talked about demeanour was perfect with both a very professional yet relaxing and engaging approach a fantastic sense of humour and seemed genuinely delighted to assist having had mixed levels of service with ba and always flying virgin i think ba need to track down this staff member and use her as the model for all future cabin crew training
 rome fiumicino to london city a ba cityflyer service no wait to check in aircraft was not full we pushed british-airwaysck early and arrived early this route still has complimentary refreshments in economy including wine – a great bonus and pleasant surprise cabin service was pleasant and professional a really excellent flight
  london to shanghai the most disappointing business class i have flown in a long time the plane was old worn and dirty there were crumbs of food on the seat and the floor from a previous flight it took 2 hours to for drinks service to reach my seat after take off  not the food followed shortly which was over cooked they seemed to be short on staff however what made me really angry was that there were people in the cabin who had had both drinks and food and were having their beds turned down before id even been offered a drink the service was exceptionally poor i am flying home tomorrow and am not looking forward to the flight as a gold card holder you might have thought ba  check their frequent fliers are being looked after ill return to using other airlines in the  world group for my long haul trips such as cathay jal or finnair the only reason that ive given more than  star is that i managed to sleep quite well  not the bedding and pillows were good ultimately though  not sorry ba not good enough
 their customer service is horrible lost our british-airwaysgs here we sit in london after 25 days of wearing the same clothing we fly out in 3 hours to barcelona for a 14 day cruise and have pretty much lost any hope of being reunited with our british-airwaysgs before we go i spent so much $$$ on this trip to celebrate my husbritish-airwaysnds 60th birthday and our 5th wedding anniversary it was supposed to be our trip of a lifetime we have really been trying to make light of things but not ting our british-airwaysgs today as it's now friday and we left on tuesday am from seattle is heartbreaking not  single person at british-airways has handled this with any kind of urgency or empathy for that matter one customer service agent even asked me if we  be ok ting out to heathrow to pick them up truly the worst customer experience i've had
  london city to zurich i fly this route a lot around 8 times per year the flight was delayed initially by an hour i was kept up to date via the app so i was not disappointed around 45 minutes into the flight  of the crew member came over with a card in his hands wishing me a happy birthday followed by a bottle of champagne brandy etc this was totally unexpected it made my day thanks to the crew
  i booked a flight from bucharest to london and return and when we were at the airport they informed us that the flight will be delayed for 5 hours from 8am to 1pm then another 1 hour and a half until 2:30 pm we lost the my we paid for the bus tickets and they  not refund returning to bucharest our flight was delayed and they did not  inform us about it i understand that unforeseen situation can happen but i have never seen such a poorly prepared company in my life
  london to calgary thank you to james a club world flight attendant on ba 0103 april 15 2019 his service was impeccable attentive and delightful i thoroughly enjoyed the flight 
  vancouver to london we were upgraded to business class at the airport the staff were absolutely delightful and had a fabulous trip really they could not have been more helpful and i  recommend them 
"  
miami to london heathrow with british-airways top deck of 747 with  experienced and  new crew members perfect welcome and appreciated the method of selecting what and when to have for breakfast had a starter and then settled down and slept better than expected on nottime arrival and aa arrivals lounge was quiet with good showers"
  houston to london the plane left an hour late while an engineer dealt with a problem ive no problem with that i like travelling safely i thought well im sure id booked an aisle seat online but it appears it was a window i missed out on the airline meal and when i realised i buzzed the steward and requested a sandwich and water explaining the problem he fetched me a sandwich and various bits hed scrabbled toher from the kitchen later when the liquid refreshment cane round both my neighbour and i requested water and i had to reach across him for my drink as he helped himself to his drink and left me to it
  london to delhi the worst business class trip for us seats much smaller than business class on singapore air thai international eva air qantas; not seated toher  not same surname mr and mrs  not but moved after no privacy on middle seats;  tiny drawer is only storage for shoes ipad makeup and sponge british-airwaysg book etc film/tv selection was very limited and my choice wasnt working the food was very poor  not main course congealed and so british-airwayssic with a dessert that was pathetic no tea coffee or chocolates offered to us breakfast had no jam with the croissant nobody came round during the flight offering extra water or other beverages the crew didnt put themselves out if  pays more for business class  expects more and we didnt  it i  never choose to travel ba again
  bucharest to london my flight with british-airways was 7 hours delayed from a european destination to london i applied for compensation for this delay initially i was informed that under eu regulations i  receive 400 euros compensation to be informed 4 days later that this was an error and that i was no longer ting compensated british-airways argued that sickness of a crew member is considered extraordinary circumstances comparable with weather issues and that therefore they do not have to compensate passengers for this flight however there are court precedence cases that clearly show that crew sickness is not to be considered an extraordinary circumstance and that it is in an airlines responsibility to have a contingency strategy for such cases or compensate if they do not i have talked to the manager of customer service and was told that there is nothing they can do as this is their policy i believe that if not on legal british-airwayssis british-airways should have compensated out of customer service reasons because a 7 hour delay within europe is significant many times i picked to fly with british-airways british-airwayssed on the expectations of good customer service in the case of anything going wrong but this experience proved to me that it's not worth investing that extra my into flying with british-airways
  london heathrow to bengaluru i found the crew very friendly and even humorous whenever the airhostesses passed through the aisle i was on a seat next to the aisle we  exchange some friendly comments which almost always lead to muffled laughs  one air hostess admitted that she enjoyed such conversations which made the stress of her work lighter 
  madrid to london we paid for business class and then paid for specific seats the original booking was from iberia part of iag which operates ba iberia and air lingus ba clearly do not integrate into iberia's systems since after paying for and closing our seats upon checking in we found our seats had been changed by ba these flights were operated by iberia and ba ba being the return leg from madrid to london heathrow ba explained that they  have to check if we were due a refund  not total joke since we paid for the seats additionally the ba said the flight was full and could not change the seats no explanation as to why we paid for specific seats in business and they were changed by ba without notice we'll accept the refund on this occasion since there is nothing else we can do and never use ba or iberia again which is a shame since iberia cs has always reflected all and iag / ba has let the customer down again just simply poor ba  and low british-airwaysr as always expected more for full fare business class rated 1/10 since as we were let down and did not receive an explanation and were initially told that we  not  a refund on the paid for allocated seats
  dublin to london heathrow british-airways offered a very good overall service on this flight i booked online and found that process very easy the caveat was not being able to select the seat i wanted ahead of travel without paying another fee the check notin lady was very friendly and helpful and gave a good account of herself the flight departed on nottime and the captain made frequent announcements within the previous two weeks i had flown with ba twice within europe and this flight was by the best of the 3 thanks to the staff the flight was relatively short but well managed with a nice drop down map and staff visibly make a real effort one curiosity was the staff handing out uk landing cards the flight was punctual and reliable
  london to seattle my seat was on the upper deck a nice perk for seattle flights to europe ba is the only  flying 747s to europe from seattle overall the product is outdated service was not at the level it used to be staff is polite and professional but they keep the service to a minimum  upper deck crew on this flight was mainly uninterested except the british-airwaysre minimum  no additional service no top ups not offering water during the flight of course if you ask for something you do  it there was also a lot of traffic on the stairway connecting upper and lower deck with the crew congregating at the lower deck  i hope ba will improve their act i certainly wont use their services in foreseeable future
  london to gibraltar check in at t3 was fine lounge was good and staff were more proactive than was previously the case flight was good with decent lunch served including the kids meals which were fine skilled landing in gibraltar not a good flight
  london to boston ba replaced a380 with a very old boeing 747 video system did not work for more than 1 hour then work for a few hours and stopped working no wifi very old plane service ok not good for business traveling
  london to doha similar to our outbound flight the seats are comfortable but behind the competition very small storage area  if you are tall try sleeping sitting up or in the cradle position as the bed is just not long enough the food portions seems like you are forced to go on a diet though the taste was ok the entertainment system had the worst selection of any airline i have flown lately  not but their check in british-airwaysggage policy makes them a very attractive option when you see what their opposition charges for excess luggage
  london heathrow to houston despite sitting at the british-airwaysck of the plane we were really well looked after without exception all of the staff in this cabin were exceptionally friendly and professional they really seemed to be enjoying their work lunch and a pre landing snack were provide toher with an ice cream mid flight commendably even in these days of austerity my pre lunch gin was served with fever tree tonic well d ba frequent drinks runs were made despite its age the jumbo was well turned out internally the only downside was because of air traffic issues at heathrow the flight arrived late this meant that we almost missed our connecting domestic flight this was mainly down to tardy immigration procedures the need to pick up our british-airwaysgs and transfer to another terminal for our ongoing flight all very stressful
  larnaca to london this a320 is totally unsuitable for a flight of this length the seat pitch and width are the same for economy and club having paid €1000 for my flight it's disgraceful on flight where you are sitting for more than 5 hours in an expensive club europe seat the personal space is so tight if the person in front reclined their seat it's a nightmare the seat in the middle is blocked but ting out if the seats in front are reclined is hazardous  you pay for a club ticket for space and comfort and  nothing 
  i booked my ba flight from zurich to london heathrow using avios my frequent flyer number had to be added 3 times during the booking process when i tried to reserve an aisle seat for medical reasons the ba website showed that all of the seats had been allocated save for a few seats for which i  have had to pay about thirty pounds the check notin area for ba at zurich airport is in a hard to find spot of the airport the check notin agent was very professional helpful and informative the area of departure from zurich was by transfer train the flight boarded in an orderly manner and left more or less on time i was dismayed to see cabin crew serve alcohol to a group of already drunk german speaking sports fans one of the cabin crew declared that she had run out of beer and then suggested to an increasingly loud and aggressive man that he might like the cider instead in the meantime the same crew members ignored me and other passengers while offering the trolley service the overhead maps were not used and the captain made minimal announcements during the flight n of which were in german the flight arrived reasonably promptly
  the booking process was easy enough but they have reduced the british-airwaysggage allowance in terms of the seats  can book the cost of including a british-airwaysg added considerably to the cheapest fare check notin was well managed and it was good to see passengers with too much luggage required to check their british-airwaysgs in departure was well managed and although there was a delay the captain communicated well my gripe is that my seat was dirty and the window was also dirty  some of the to buy m&s food items were not available and the lavatory i used was dirty the staff were very professional and pleasant and the drop notdown route map was nice especially for the younger passengers to enjoy hardworking crew
  london to tokyo narita had a fantastic flight in the new ba first cabin on the boeing 787 on both journeys the crew were outstanding as was the food and the service the food was of high end restaurant standard the seat comfortable
  bridown to london gatwick paid for a business class flight the onboard service was abysmal no refreshments offered on boarding dinner took three hours to be served on a night flight my husbritish-airwaysnd had to go to the galley twice for his dinner requests hed been forgotten i requested ‘express service which didnt happen website advertises ‘premium levels of service and ‘every journey unique and unfortable the service was dreadful but the journey was definitely unfortable for the wrong reasons dont waste your my with this airline you dont  what you pay for and they try to compensate by offering loyalty points and telling you that you dont pay for the service that the extra costs are for taxes the lounge and extra loyalty points all ba could respond with was a goodwill gesture of loyalty points really
  st lucia to gatwick on which my wife and i were both involuntarily downgraded from premium economy to economy due overbooking on the flight it should be noted that at no time was there any announcement for volunteers for downgrading at vieux fort airport i now know from your cabin crew that it is normal practice for appeals for volunteers to be put over the tannoy system before any enforced downgrades at the time of going through the british-airwaysggage hall ting our boarding passes we queried them as n had seat numbers on them to which we were told to just to go through security and our seats  be allocated when we went through the departure gate once in the departure lounge all four of us were tannoyed to return to the british-airwaysggage hall when we were then told that my wife and i were being downgraded to economy the male telling us this more or less indicated this was the only way we  be ting on the flight giving us £75 per each on a prepayment card as compensation under article 73 of ec 261/2004 stating however that this did not affect our statutory rights he then told us he  find us in the departure lounge and then all four of us had to go through security once again the male who we spoke to in the british-airwaysggage hall did not come and find us we had to go and find him when he also told me that he had put my wife and i on a row with no other passengers which we assumed rightly or wrongly was so we could not tell people sitting beside us about the poor service we had received from ba however two other passengers did come and sit beside us with the passenger sitting beside my wife telling her this was because the seat they had been allocated was soaking wet and smelt of urine and the cabin crew had asked them to sit on it with a cushion which they had refused and so they were given the seats next to us which was no problem what further concerned me even more was  of your cabin crew walking past another passenger with their seat in the reclined position on three separate occasions just prior to approaching gatwick and after the pilot had requested seat belts on and seats in upright positions never telling the passenger to raise their seat bas latest advert celebrates 100 years of ba but for me their service is going british-airwaysckwards the music that accompanies the advert is called ‘salvation and by the end of the flight my wife and i were surely seeking it article 10 of ec regulation 261/2004 is worth reading if this happens to you
  chicago to london cancelled flights just a few hours before i left home then put me on a different flight which  have made it impossible to make my connecting flight was finally put on a different flight on the way home because my first flight was through american airlines and the second through british-airways all in the same booking i was only able to check in and  a seat on the american airlines flight as i was redirected every time to their website couldnt check in for the british-airways flight so had to have a middle seat which is very uncomfortable i always check in 24 hours before to guarantee a seat but ba nt allow me to do this
  london to bangalore this was the worst experience i flew with my infant daughter ande cabin crew was extremely rude i was surprised that there was no way to heat milk for my daughter i found the food portions so meagre not sufficient for a child also  british-airways is sad in every sense of the term
  hamburg to abu dhabi via heathrow the 15h flight from hamburg to heathrow was like flying a bud carrier no free service at all everything has to be purchased at inflated prices heathrow t5 the usual chaos i can use the f lounge due to my one world status massive lounge crowded with the charm and food quality of a cafeteria toilets filthy one of the worst lounges ive seen boarding orderly and well organized boeing 788 ife screen broken seats very uncomfortable and narrow service and food quality average flight abu dhabi to heathrow delayed by almost an hour due to late arrival of the flight crew this is something i have never experieinced before rest of the journey uneventful overall a rather disappointing experience ba cannot compete with the middle eastern carriers
  london to seville following on from mistakenly booking a return flight with ba despite having a previous confirmed booking with a competitor i quickly called up ba to resolve the issue they understood the problem and gave me a full refund the agent was exceptionally helpful on the ph and provided me a quick answer and solution to the problem i dont believe most airlines  have accepted my reasoning however its great to see ba treat their customers with care
  doha to paris via london this is the first time using ba since october 2002 nothing has changed  the same reversible business class seats with very little storage space still comfortable but the business has caught up with ba and left them behind with very poor entertainment selection and limited food choice it cannot compare with other business leaders like cathay and qatar airways but on this route ba charges the same price as qatar airways but delivers a much poorer product though the service was ok not as personal but alright where they are better is with their check in luggage policy of 2 british-airwaysgs 32 kgs each they are superior and generous i will still use them but look forward to them rolling in the new business class
  madrid to london ba0457 on the 18/03 could not have been a better service long time since i flew club europe but it was an amazing experience the welcome aboard was excellent and so was the service and food stephen  of the flight attendants was so attentive and happy to help that he probritish-airwaysbly made it the best short haul flight experience i have had in a long time well d to the crew on that flight
 on the flight to tokyo i was separated from my wife even though it was our hymoon thanks the return felt like a 12 hour easyjet flight one meal and  half meal limited drinks very small seats im 5 foot 9 and my knees touched the seat in front very very mediocre
  london to vancouver check in agent very helpful in searching out seat options very smooth process the disappointment was the receptionist at the galleries lounge at t3 who was rude and unhelpful all was redeemed once on board the crew were excellent throughout the flight in the best british-airways tradition  not friendly helpful and attentive food not great but on a par with economy in other airlines wines better than many airlines the aircraft was clean and reasonably well maintained for an older 747 not400 ife selection good
 the first class z at heathrow t5 and the concorde lounge are very good service on board was excellent in both directions the cabin layout is unimpressive and the food is nothing to write home about the screen is small with poor resolution i enjoyed the flights in both directions mainly because of the service this first does not compare well with that of middle eastern and asian airlines but ba business class is so poor i either fly economy or when i am very lucky try to fly first
  i had a miserable experience in first class from london to chicago i had requested a special meal but that was not available when i complained to customer relations they simply said too british-airwaysd and insulted me by offering 10 k miles the british-airwaysthroom lacked amenities and i found the service was british-airwaysrebs the angled suite is not private and when i stretched my feet hit a metal british-airwaysnd in the middle of the foot rest video screen is small and must be stowed away 20 min before landing cabin crew never asked what i wanted and were only available when you press the call button in flight entertainment is poor 
  leeds bradford to las vegas via heathrow customer services handling of my question never answered it three times i asked them to explain why the cost of my  checked british-airwaysg caused the fare to increase over £100 on the outbound flight this was before any increase other than the increase announced for the short lba lhr fare i asked why the fare was so much when i could have booked a seat for the british-airwaysg for about £50 the response was we are doing what every else is doing they never could explain why the fare increased by over £100 when i indicated  checked british-airwaysg i asked to speak with some but that was never responded to book lhr las at that time and  british-airwaysg included customer service apparently did not understand what i was asking because the answer provided was non notresponsive 
  dallas to london heathrow in first class this is the worst experience i have had on a flight the crew was indifferent and unresponsive and treated you more like you were a nuisance to them there was even less service from this so called first class crew than you  in tourist class in most airlines the attitude and service of the crew was abysmal when you have average food and wine on offer and a rather outdated cabin in first class at least you should prioritize service as your competitive advantage to your full paying customers this was nothing but a waste of my i doubt very much i will go british-airwaysck to british-airways again
  tenerife to heathrow effectively a bud airline masquerading at premium airline prices have flown several bud airlines in the past which have offered far more in terms of value for my and service seats are rigid and i felt as if i was leaning forward for the the majority of the flight when i tried to put my seat british-airwaysck to recline i estimate it moved around 5 degrees leg room is also non existent m&s food ran out halfway through the 5 hour flight and although cabin crew were apoloic for food to run out during a lunchtime flight is inexcusable and highlights how british-airwaysdly the airline is being managed by the upper echelons furthermore several other bud airlines at the airport had flights leaving directly from the terminal requiring no bussing of passengers ba again in a move to save my opt for bussing passengers to the far reaches of the airport to avoid paying extra charges for utilising direct access from airport terminals ca not fault the staff onboard who are clearly dedicated to the ba brand they are professional friendly and courteous it's clear that british-airways are not the airline they once were and i hope that passengers begin to vote with their feet as drastic changes are needed to bring the airline british-airwaysck to its former glory
 heathrow to larnaca  not departed on time flight nearly full m&s food available to passengers ran out while cabin crew were half way down the aisle larnaca to heathrow  not two messages received while in larnaca airport  not the flight  be delayed by over an hour notdeparture was supposed to be at 715 pm but we took off nearer to 9 pm the second message was that there was no food to be served on the flight we recognise that this does not meet with the standards you expect from us the flight was 5 hours long notso this combination of a delayed departure and no food available on board is totally unacceptable  not worse than a bud airline a midnight arrival at heathrow was then compounded by off loading cargo before the passengers because of a british-airwayslance problem in addition i was incorrectly charged eur 75 on the return leg for my case  not it was clearly the same case that i travlled out to cyprus with but the system identified it as extra british-airwaysggage cattle class is an under rated description of the service offered to customers the only saving grace was the cabin crew notparticularly the customer service manager notwho promised to follow up the british-airwaysggage issue and logged my complaint it will take ages to resolve but he was helpful and pleasant throughout how british-airways can offer such a poor product and expect people to keep flying with them is beyond me
  los angeles to london a very enjoyable and comfortable flight on the new recliner seat set up on the 787 ba have raised their game and provides a superior seat to make for a relaxed flight  if you are travelling solo a retractable divider gives you privacy from your neighbour only problem is the 2x3x2 layout is  too many seats across as it leaves two very narrow gangways; if you have an aisle seat in the turn right section in business class you will be constantly whacked unintentionally by economy section passengers with their carry notons when boarding food and drinks were excellent with courses served separately and the wine bottle frequently produced by flight attendants who gave a great service to their passengers entertainment choice also excellent with a film choice for every thanks also to two people most of us for  not the flight crew who got us safely to heathrow 15 minutes early and put the plane down so gently we hardly noticed we had arrived well d ba for providing such a good product and service
  london to phoenix ba289 yesterday the plane was supposed to land at 1835 however it landed at 1940 because of this i missed my connecting flight to ontario california aboard american airlines by the time i was able to go through custom and pick up my luggage it was already 2030 the flight departs at 2037 i went to the ground crew of american airlines they told me that i will not be able to make it to my connecting flight as they are already on the runway they then directed me to british-airways i went to the ground attendant of british-airways and she told me to go british-airwaysck to american airlines to  it re booked i went british-airwaysck to american airlines then they told me again to british-airwaysck to british-airways since they are they the  who caused the delay i went british-airwaysck to british-airways with the american airlines supervisor the british-airways attendant gave me a card with the customer service number and told me to call them in the morning she did not offer any explanations or anything american airlines said we can re booked it for tomorrow morning but they did not offer any accommodation i ended up ting my own car rental and drove from phoenix to california in the middle of the night since i was not able to resolve this issues with both airlines
  san francisco to london after paying £4000 for flights which i had to cancel they  not allow any change of dates or change of name and after all that  not give me the  avios points because i wont be on the flight
  rome to london one of the best european airlines to travel with for short haul flights the online website is very clear and easy to use check notin procedure was smooth the gate was very close to the shopping area boarding the flight was very well organised and quick and through the airbridge the only negative aspect is that you will need to pay for a drink as they dont serve anything free on all european routes
  cologne to gatwick in economy class with an silver status ba card no online check notin available  ba website suggests passenger to arrive at the airport 3 hours before flight departure but airport check notin the only available option starts 2 hours before departure no lounge available there is a lounge in the terminal open to other airline customers except ba no priority boarding for business and elite level passengers boarding the plane by bus not even free water on board in economy
  tampa to gatwick i paid to have my seats bumped up to business class and when i got to the airport they  not let me on the flight because some on their side messed up when they booked my seats so instead of honoring my seats they just sat there for an hour telling me they ca not do anything and i ca not  on the plane they waited till the very last second before the check in period closed to reissue my tickets and wo not reimburse me for the seats that i paid for but never received 
 london heathrow to madrid i travel from lhr regularly british-airways have proved to be reliable and their service is of good quality as a frequent traveler i've been able to use the priority boarding and also managed to  exit row seats this airline is very good with providing tangible benefits to silver members the lounge at heathrow terminal 5 is also very good and provides a good selection of food and refreshments the british-airwaysr is very well stocked and also a good selection of soft drinks available i'm very happy with the airline service and  definitely recommend british-airways keep it up guys
  gatwick to st lucia return recently returned from a two week holiday with my wife in caribbean for a 60th birthday celebration tickets bought in august 2018 and decided to spoil ourselves with a club class return having flown out premium economy arrived at airport to be told that we'd been downgraded to premium economy due to overbooking apoloic ground staff defending the indefensible but no apology on the plane fuming all the way british-airwaysck to london exacerbritish-airwaysted by hopeless cabin staff service tea when i asked for coffee and filthy food complained on return through ba exec club webiste with response from customer service 10 days later ba claims that overbooking is a very rare occurrence and gave a lukewarm apology evidence from ground staff on both journeys contradicts this and it seems to be a standard occurrence during peak season we booked early so probritish-airwaysbly had relatively cheap seats ba has presumably made my by selling our tickets to a higher bidder general quality of ba service food and wine has fallen dramatically over the last few years ba is now effectively a low cost airline flying a fleet of very tired aircraft trying to preserve the gloss of a quality airline the accountants may win in the short term but passengers will vote with their feet avoid this airline if you possible can and the final insult in booking premium seats with ba is that you  charge £40 to pre reserve in club and £70 in premium economy ba you are having a laugh with the flying public on this performance you do not deserve to stay in business
  it's been many years since i flew long haul british-airways and i was pleasantly surprised by recent flights ba staff used to be offhand and inhospitable but that's all changed from the time of arriving at london heathrow t5 the staff have been really friendly and helpful similarly on the flight the attendants could not do enough for me when i requested tomato juice with worcester sauce the attendant made a special trip to the rear to  it on the way british-airwaysck i asked for a tonic water and again they offered to go and  it the seating of these newer planes allows me knee room even though i'm 6ft 3ins and the headrest can be slid up high enough too the entertainment system though a little quirky in its operation and menu system compared to the slickness of cathay pacific nevertheless had a good range of movies and tv to watch both flights ended up arriving on time despite delays at heathrow both ways and the pilots kept us cheerfully informed as what was going on food quality was reasonable again not up to the standard of cathay pacific rather let down by a filled croissant for breakfast which i thought was a bit mean overall a very pleasant flight thanks ba is this because competition is hotting up and ba now have to try harder
" 
london heathrow / pisa return my wife and i fly this route 3 not4 times a year as we have a home in tuscany sometimes we pay in long advance to  a decent price or we pay using avios this return trip was the latter it is what it is the most miserable rip off for a business class seat in the world i have seen last minute flights on this route as high as £700 return ba should be ashamed of themselves the only reason we fly this product is that you  the business class lounges in both directions the seating is at the front of the plane for a speedy exit the new meals are quite good and the free is it really free booze the seats are the biggest con three seats for two  not with a dumb table in the middle unless you are in the front row the leg room is a disaster on the way out we had a nice tomato and mozzarella salad + wine on the way british-airwaysck  not a ploughman's lunch it was okay notish as a 60 year old businessman  who has worked globritish-airwayslly in my career in the us japan and the middle east  not and having sold my business a few years ago to  of the largest plcs in the country  not i think i know a bit about running companies i know i could do a lot better than the current board at ba last week when i was away i read that ba have posted well in excess of  billion profits last year oh what a surprise and that's the clear objective of the directors so what  i do with club europe i'd make it the best in europe the seat  be larger like an arm chair a 2+2 configuration there  be a nice centre table charge ports for phs/laptops headsets tv screens mainly for news  not but some movies for flights over 2 hours extra 6 of leg room behind row 1 nice cutlery and glass/china ware hot meals and i'd probritish-airwaysbly sell it at £25 a flight more build value guys and the profits will follow its the oldest dictum in the book i will give credit where credit is due on the way british-airwaysck on the ground the captain announced there was possible a technical problem with the starboard aileron as an aviation buff i loseley understood the problem and figured it was not really a big deal clearly some passengers were worried we were on a duff plane he picked up on that and took the initiative to take a relaxed walk the length of plane asking if any had concerns or questions one or two did and he answered their concerns in a calm and thoughtful way and explained he was only taking a precautionary measure very nice chap we took off 2 hours later when it was fixed and everything was fine fas in both directions were very good"
 edinburgh to boston via london the planes are ancient and need to be replaced if these were cars they  have an antique plate the seats are uncomfortable and worn there is no lumbritish-airwaysr support the space between the seatbritish-airwaysck in front and your face is inches its really claustrophobic the food is awful and last evening we were not offered a choice so for $1200 each we had horrible seats and terrible food the short connecting flights do not even offer bottled water the m&s menu is expensive and offers limited choices meal deals in the airport convenience and drug stores offer much better options for less than half the price the planes on both long legs of the trip last week were filthy the cabin crew on the bos to lhr and lhr to edi were good there was  member in the lhr to bos who was snippy to passengers and seemed put out by needing to do her job boarding is supposed to be by group but was a disaster as people queued up well before their section was called and it made it extremely difficult to  to board british-airways has become like a bud airline who does not charge bud pricing
  gatwick to mauritius my wife and 2 friends booked and paid £56 each to select our seats with additional legroom adjacent to the british-airwaysssinet stowage on boarding the flight the configuration of the aircraft differed meaning we had the same seat row and number but without the additional legroom my formal complaint to ba has been met with what can only be described as condescending platitudes and a blank refusal to refund our seat booking fee we feel that this a scam and are continuing to pursue the matter trading standards are also being informed it didnt help the aircraft was delayed by 4 hours on the outward leg was filthy dirty the return flight had numerous ife defects and my seat recline did not work i also noted a number of cabin minor airworthiness issues i am a licensed engineer a marketing email in celebration of 100 years of service has thanked me for flying hundreds of thousands of miles with ba and then rips me off with nothing in return british-airways you are a disgrace  your act toher and provide the service you were once famed for
  flew out of heathrow on 22nd feb to new york 20 mins into our flight and we noticed our tv's were not working 4 travellers but i have to say the cabin crew managed to reset them and they we were working within the hour the reason for reviewing this is how wonderful the crew were the crew on this flight were amazing nothing was too much trouble thank you to all involved on that flight
  horrible flight ba from gatwick to cape town and iberia on the return i am only 5'2 8st 10 and i find the leg room too cramp the onboard flight entertainment system was down on the ba flight most of the time it was probritish-airwaysbly in the last 2 hours of the flight before they managed to fix it and the system was old fashid and movies were streamed on a loop the food was british-airwaysrely edible coming british-airwaysck on iberia the entertainment system was better and the food was also better but the seats legroom was just as british-airwaysd i was almost bumped off my connecting flight at mad due to the lockers being filled up i had another connection to make at lhr and i was not going to miss that so i had to insist they let me on though loads of other passengers were led off this was the worst flight i have flown on last long haul ba flight for me
  new york to venice via london staff have been nice when around but aircraft food assistance and information all deplorable booked business class first flight overnight from jfk to heathrow  not quick mediocre food service then g chair is set up so im staring at a stranger its uncomfortable and difficult to maneuver with no instructions didnt wake me for breakfast not sure why they had me fill in a form for when i wanted to be woken up no instructions for the transition between ba flights now im on the flight from heathrow to venice no offer of coffee water but worse business class is just coach class no extra leg room just 3 seats with the middle  blocked out person in front of me put their seat british-airwaysck and my knees are in my chest i didnt pay for international business class to  stuck in uncomfortable seats for 2 long flights i wont fly ba again 
  chicago to london heathrow club class on british-airways is without doubt the worst in the airline industry  it is british-airwaysd enough that ba persist using out of date airplanes circa 25 year old b747 not400's but they perpetuate the dreadful ying/yang seating arrangement of club class where you have to look directly at the passenger next to you and raise a screen for privacy then mid notflight the crew lower the screen to serve the food to leave the seat  has to climb over the legs of a sleeping passenger;~no mean feat in the dark the crew from chicago were appalling and dumped the food upon us as quickly as possible breakfast was inedible and i returned it uneaten the lounge at o'hare was a crowded tiny dirty facility with a food british-airwaysr including some wilted veables and crackers with cheese insufficient chairs and a single old tv does no  at ba care how bad they have become for premium class passengers
  london to chicago could it  any worse the flight to chicago was equipped with the usual ancient boeing 747 not400 the british-airways first class product does not come up to modern business class standards this particular flight was late again and the food / wine was simply awful there is nothing remotely elegant about ba first class and the crew demonstrate no sophistication this experience was like dining at your worst restaurant chain finally not only is the aircraft tired and worn out but the in flight so notcalled entertainment system did not work and had to be rebooted twice the first class seat is a british-airwaysd joke and extraordinarily uncomfortable british-airways are at least twenty years out of date with their entire first class product all that can be said about this airline is woeful the concorde first class lounge at heathrow is filthy dirty and desperately needs refurbishment
  prague to london heathrow very disappointing service cabin crew only managed to offer drinks to half the cabin on a two hour flight that was already delayed  not payment machine was broken staff ran british-airwaysckwards and forwards as nothing seemed available on the trolley on the bright said i did save by not having to pay the over inflated prices
  london city to florence my flight was at around 7am in the morning not only it got canceled 3 hours before but at the moment there was no ph line open to call and manage a rebooking on their site i had the option to reschedule my flight but i couldnt select any flights on the same day interestingly i was able to find & book another  through skyscanner again with ba at the day of my initial flight with £100 more of course why couldnt they simple show me this flight on the reschedule page 
  london to johannesburg since the aircraft was half full i was looking for a great flight we left on time and that was the only positive point i started watching a movie and a young flight attendant  approached and asked for my dinner choice i told her that i  love a g&t to start with and then i will read the menu she told me that this was a late evening departure 9pm is not late for me and that no pre notdinner drinks  be served i insisted this is business class after all half full flight 30 minutes later she brought a tray with everything on it g&t first dish main dish and dessert  never was i offered wine or coffee the lights were turned off and i did not see a flight attendant until 1:30 hours before landing  other passengers in business where treated the same and complained
  doha to london heathrow flight on time not completely full had an aisle seat near british-airwaysck of plane without the entertainment box in the way some reviews say that the last few windows are blanked off at rear of the aircraft but not so on this plane breakfast was served which was ok cabin crew mixed mostly young and worked quickly crew uniform still looks a bit tatty compared with rivals in this part of the world there is good and british-airwaysd still with ba  not british-airwaysd was the so called chicken wrap served just before arrival  not leathery and inedible  not why do they let themselves down with such a poor offering  not hardly any passengers near me could eat it bad was that there was an old tissue and food wrapper in my seat pocket good was the newer aircraft and the breakfast has improved arrived on time at heathrow but to a remote stand
  miami to tel aviv via london at miami airport on october 2018 what a pleasure was dealing with the agent so professional nice and helpful to the every last detail now on february 2019 calling british-airways to redeem my avios what another pleasure dealing with a patient knowledgeable and nice agent she explained everything in such detail you are doing great with such fantastic employees 
  london to seoul i normally fly business but this was a last minute flight and the cost of club was prohibitive and so i thought i  give world traveller plus a go the cabin is stylish and intimate and i was surprised how roomy and comfortable the seats were the entertainment system was working well although the adverts before every single showing are very annoying i was happy with the headphs and small amenity kit and felt the staff were very welcoming my only complaint was the slightly pointless menu we were given as for lunch neither of the meals listed were actually available a similar thing happened with breakfast three options the third being the most appetizing and no it had not been loaded so this is an area ba might want to look into all in all the service was good and worth the price for ground service ba please at least keep a couple of desks for people to check into before automation puts us all out of work
  london heathrow to new york jfk bag drop did not go well lounge galleries north  was good and not crowded boarding was fine small delay well organised pre take off drink was better than the  i got in club world 2 weeks previous main meal good pre flight snack was average but my son really liked it on time arrival a good flight cabin crew included some of the older staff who are not mixed fleet crew and it stands out a mile i thought this was a good flight
 san diego to london from the moment that i boarded this flight due to take off at 1925 the crew had  interest and  only  not to  the cabin lights off which they duly achieved two hours later as a consequence the service was negligent in the extreme this was a club world ticket  not so expensive and i looked forward to a decent level of service however i was not offered champagne on boarding wine with my meal or coffee and port after my meal i complained to ba when i got home but they were not interested and i was met with a british-airwaysrrage of corporate platitudes this flight was a disappointing end to what had been a great trip to the us & mexico and has left me with a very poor view of the airline
  gatwick to st lucia flew ba new revamped business class today and a huge improvement on the old set up well lit cabin improved seating comfort better and operational entertainment system always hit or miss before and decent food cabin crew worked hard and were pleasant i have observed along with every else the falling standards at ba and have moved most of my travel to rival airlines but on the british-airwayssis of todays experience i will consider them in the future much improved well d
  london to chennai it was amazing the crew were very friendly the food was amazing and the seats were comfortable t was overall an amazing flight and i enjoyed it thoroughly
"  london to tampa ba broke my suitcase and i did not make a fuss i just got a new  the new  was too large for the overhead bin on the return flight the only suitcase i could purchase while abroad so on top of the new suitcase i had to actually pay ba to check the new british-airwaysg cost me over $100 for their mistake they also shovel off customer service to some company abroad you will  an email a month later saying i'd like to know you that we are unable to offer refund make a big fuss at the airport if they break your stuff so that you can avoid this black hole they call customer service

  my husbritish-airwaysnd and i flew on british-airways flight ba not228 from baltimore to london heathrow leaving on the 12th february 2019 every aspect of the flight was poorer than what bud airlines have to offer the plane was shabby and dated the seat reclining facility did not operate properly was not that comfortable and we had less legroom than the equivalent with bud airlines the touch screen tv monitor was not working properly one ear bud on the headphs did not work the audio socket was too loose for the headphs so the plug kept falling out making it difficult to enjoy the in notflight entertainment which in itself had a dated choice the pillow was disgusting and kept falling out of the flimsy cover the air conditioning lacked consistency alternating between very hot and very cold air the restroom occupied sign always lit up as vacant even if it was occupied however what made the flight very unpleasant was the british-airwaysd attitude of the cabin crew they were abrupt unfriendly and quite clearly did not want to be there there was  exception an extremely pleasant older crew member who greeted us on and off the flight there did not appear to be any organisation or smooth co notordination when distributing the meals our two trays of food where placed on top of each other and practically thrown at us by a sour faced crew member this flight was  hour late making us nervous about catching our connecting flight there was no information or instructions given to us about connecting flight gate numbers before we landed unlike all the other airlines that i have travelled with there were no staff member greeting the connecting customers to point them in the right direction or re notassure them british-airways  be my last choice of an airline to travel with and i  only fly with them again if there was no other option
  bridown to gatwick i could not imagine that first class on ba  be the same as travelling in business class with for example qatar emirates etihad singapore thai etc for double the price cabin seats and food equals business class one of the red wines on the wine list was out from start when i left london outbound cabin crew worked well and gave splendid service but first class on ba is not worth the fare when i complained to customer service after i got home all i got was they are in the process of upgrading world traveller 
  london to athens classic ba love and hate relationship where  flight is perfect and another  is a total disaster problems in december 2018 at heathrow check notin when ba check notin and british-airwaysggage management it systems went down for at least 90 minutes total chaos with people like myself arrived at the airport 2:30 hours before the flight and queuing while others arriving 45 minutes prior to their departure and given priority even though we were checked in at some point the flight was delayed by 2+ hours on top of the problems then flight does not have enough food onboard at least the crew clearly attempted to reduce flight time to the minimum
  i booked a british-airways flight from amsterdam to london heathrow in the beginning everything went normal and smooth check notin and boarding was easy and on time and once every boarded the problems started  after another first an announcement was made by the pilot about a flight delay due to strong winds in heathrow fair enough afterwards the wind problem was resolved but a passenger decided to leave so they had to take out his luggage after that we received a 3rd announcement stating there is a computer malfunction at schiphol airport and they are doing their best to resolve it this caused us already about 45 not60 mins delay but me and other passenger still remained calm and relaxed and then the hell started we received permission to take off after 7 mins and then the pilot offered passengers who do not wish to travel to leave the plane of course there were many passengers who were travelling on business and i guess too delayed to make it on time for their meetings so they decided to leave the crew warned them that this might cause terrible delay and problems for the other passengers but they still decided to leave so a group of passengers left and we missed our opportunity to take off then the pilot announced that we can take off after 25 or 3 hours the flight was full of overseas travellers we spent 2 hours sitting in a plane which was not moving anywhere people unboarded the plane 4 times in total and no food or water was offered to us we had to line up next to the british-airwaysthroom to purchase food and drinks and pay for it the overall experience was terrible and it ruined the whole plan for my first day in london
  flying premium economy on british-airways from new orleans to london was an absolute pleasure the nine hour flight was an amazing experience with great legroom reclining seat for a nice sleep and low noise definitely recommend and will be flying premium on long haul again
  tokyo to london i was looking forward to this flight because of the club world ticket and because it was my first time flying on a boeing 787 we had a good check notin experience breezed through the airport and enjoyed the jal lounge at narita we boarded on time and first impressions of the boeing 787 were good: a modern plane with nice mood lighting as we boarded the food and wines were really good i had a beautifully notpresented japanese starter followed by a bento notstyle lunch as a final reminder of the holiday and my wife chose the western options there was plenty of choice on the ife and there was a big screen on the downside the cabin was too hot which made it difficult to sleep on the flight this was a problem that we encountered on our outbound journey too the seat was comfortable and reclined fully but i find the layout of ba club world a little awkward because you have to step over another passenger's footrest to access the aisle the cabin crew were efficient but seemed a bit exhausted and could have been more friendly and welcoming the context to this review is that we spoiled ourselves and flew in first class on the way to tokyo we had an amazing experience with such comfortable seats and exemplary service from the cabin crew we both felt a bit disappointed with the return flight in comparison and felt there was room for improvement but at the same time our expectations might have been too high because of the previous flight
  london to tokyo haneda my wife and i treated ourselves to first class flights for our holiday to japan with the help of my avios and a ba amex companion voucher we were very excited about flying first class and the dedicated check notin area at heathrow was great we boarded on time and the cabin did not disappoint we had very grand seats with lovely surroundings the cabin staff who looked after us were fantastic and really took the time to  to know us and understand what we wanted the food and alcoholic drinks were great i went for beef main course followed by the amazing chocolate and toffee pudding i was ready to sleep after all that food but saw that there was lots of choice and a large screen for the ife my wife and i both said afterwards that it did not feel like a long nothaul flight because the time passed so quickly and comfortably my only complaint is that the cabin was uncomfortably hot while we were cruising which made it harder to sleep
  i was flying london to billund today via british-airways and i was a bit hesitant as ive never flown with this airline due to early morning traffic i was running a little behind schedule and i had a 23kg british-airwaysg to also check in and check in closed 45 mins before my flight departs upon arrival i was greeted my a young gentlemen who was very helpful and respectful he calmed me down and reassured me that everything was going to be okay as i was very very stressed thinking i was going to miss my flight he then offered to give me fast track through security so i could  to my gate quicker i just want to thank him again as he made my experience with british-airways like no other and im very grateful
  san diego to frankfurt via london it all started when trying to check in online 24h before departure from san diego to heathrow on long flights like this i always reserve an aisle seat online check notin did not work no reason was given ok lets call us hotline i tried at least 40 times answers were either that call could not be completed check number or due to heavy call volume they could not process call right now i did not make it through as an act of desperation i today called a british number the lady told me guess what: no more aisle seats available some other numbers i tried were available on weekdays only good to know if you need help on a sunday so i‘ve got the strong feeling that they do not even care about there customers b on my flight to san diego 5 days ago my tv screen was g and there was no way to change seats great overall experience
 flown with british-airways on numerous occasions with no issues however on this occasion my british-airwaysggage was lost on arrival at gatwick there was no british airways representative at the british-airwaysggage claim however there was a ph that allowed me to call the british-airwaysggage department reclaiming lost british-airwaysggage was simple and my british-airwaysg was put on the next flight to singapore which i received the following day
 flying last sunday from geneva to piladelphia via london in business class when i arrived at the boarding gate in london to take my flight to philadelphia they told me that there was no sufficient business seat available they overbooked my choice was then either to fly ecenomy or to take the next flight they just did not care about their customer no ph call no email no indication at the lounge nothing until i was at the boarding gate i kindly accepted to take the next flight the plane was delayed by 1 hour due to technical issues when i arrived at philadelphia no suitcase no british-airways desk on arrival it was late no  could help i finally retrieve my suitcase 3 days later: broken during these 3 days it was impossible to  some on the ph on my flight british-airwaysck to geneva same issue no sufficient business class seats available it is clear that this company just do not care about their customers they just care about their my 
  london heathrow to paris cdg quick and easy flight to paris took just 40 minutes to reach cdg everything went well and the cabin was very clean the only complaint was boarding which too way too long and was very unorganized
  johannesburg to london at johannesburg used ba galleries lounge which was fine if a little busy plane boarded on time very hot due to lack of auxiliary power unit given aircraft at jnb all day perhaps this could have been addressed after take off the crew dispensed with pre dinner drinks and went straight for meal portions of starter very small i was given some elses by mistake which was then taken away and given to him i thought that originally the idea of the new club world meal involved a trolley service but no sign of that main was good beef dessert was cheese very small british-airwayssic selection then bed gap in seat made lie flat less comfortable breakfast was ok delay with british-airwaysggage due to another aircraft technical issue there seemed to be a few of these arrivals lounge was good overall an average experience
 edinburgh to bangalore via heathrow rude staff poor service missing british-airwaysggage poor entertainment system i spilled my drink and the attitude of the staff was brutal i apologised for my clumsiness but i was made to feel like i had deliberately d some shameful act in public and staff  not want to have anything to do with me i asked for tissues and the answer was  it from the toilet the staff did not even have the courtesy to ask me if i needed another drink once i cleaned myself up the crew were also extremely noisy chatting and laughing loudly at the pantry place for the entire duration and then  not while boarding at edinburgh they offered to check in my second british-airwaysg for free because cabin was full the staff wrote bangalore via heathrow but my british-airwaysg was not loaded to connecting flight 4 hours gap mind you 
"  
berlin to johannesburg via london the short haul flight between berlin and london was okay they do not include drinks or snacks anymore on short distance flights and prices onboard for them are compared to some low notcost carriers high because of an engine problem the flights from lhr to jnb was delayed by 2:45h british-airways gave £5 vouchers out to compensate for snacks and drinks inside the a380 the ife boxes under the window seats take a big part of the available leg space"
 new york jfk to london heathrow with british-airways an extremely average flight nothing stood out as good and nothing stood out as british-airwaysd the flight was smooth and felt quite short the cabin crew was helpful and everything was comfortable the inflight entertainment needed some work
  i've always favoured british-airways and will always try and choose to fly with them which is mostly decided by flight times for my business travel i have always found it better value over the cheaper airlines via their additonal benefits like early check notin and on notflight catering for economy however ba have stripped both the above perks i now struggle to see the value and put their offering almost beside that of the likes of easyjet yet you pay almost double then today i flew british-airwaysck from denmark with sas and it was amazing and made ba look cheap not only do you  a good meal on board you  free drink can charge your electronics and  wifi for only 29 euros outstanding
 new york to london via geneva with british-airways the plane was late not an issue but some flight attendants were not really friendly in their manner they seemed in a rush to finish the service and then chill loudly on a 7 hour flight they served us the food 40mins after departure then 20mins at the most after started clearing we were not even close to finish eating then 5 mins after another staff member just came by an took most of the food we didnt even had time to tell him not to this was really poor service especially to realise that because the aircraft was only half booked they were actually rushing us to be able to stop serving and take a nap comfortably on the raws of empty seats next to us thats what you call british-airwaysd customer service ps: i was charged 100$ for a luggage after buying my ticket 350$
 a380 boarding is always a nightmare but it was complicated on this occasion by multiple pax in wheelchairs and a delayed show notup by the pilots fortunately we still managed to take off more or less on time the cabin crew responsible for our side of the first cabin was personable but lacked experience the food served for dinner was a mixture of good and mediocre warm salmon on ice cold salad is never a pleasant experience the seats in first are reasonably comfortable although they lack the privacy of competitors' premium cabin the duvet was made redundant because of the typically overheated cabin one of the first toilets was out of action so we had to make use of the club world loos upstairs it  have been helpful if cabin crew had apologised for the inconvenience for the lack of the convenience but no comment was made the ife was passable and the sound quality good if 's own noise cancelling headphs are used wifi was available but i did not make use of it breakfast was unremarkable and i wish bread rather than pastries was offered deplaning was delayed by half notan nothour because of early morning congestion at t5 and the lack of a stand overall a reasonable flight but not first class
" 
the 2 not3 not2 seating in the front section of club world on the upper deck feels marginally less cramped than 2 not4 not2 but it's showing its age in contrast to other carriers a full cabin also means queues for the two loos although they're a lot more spacious than in first the drinks and dinner service took a good couple of hours but the revamped club world food is definitely an improvement the fish option for the main course was some of the best food i've had in the air the white company bedding does little to cushion the rather hard seats cabin crew were generally good and the csm was particularly visible during the flight breakfast was improved with the option to pre notselect items arrival was ahead of schedule"
  london to johannesburg smooth check in via club world desks fast track security was fast and got to lounge quickly lounge was ok food a little better and staff seemed more attentive we were able to use the spa which was nice showers were fine with no queues flight left on time my first experience of the new club world catering which seemed to go well slept for 5 hours lie flat on the newer aircraft is better than the older 777s which as my son says have a gap between stool and seat sometimes crew on this sector were good and the fa serving our area was experienced and it showed the csd seemed to go through the motions only arrival fine and british-airwaysggage was first on belt a good flight
  ba836 on 19 jan excellent short flight from heathrow to dublin in club europe cabin crew were warm and efficient and the overall service excellent the club europe catering was excellent i had pre notordered a gluten notfree meal which was the same as  of the standard passenger meals but with gluten notfree bread the main course was beef ratatouille with a do&co dessert pot this was the best inflight meal i've had on a short haul flight on arrival in dublin the ground service from swissport was poor it took some time for steps to meet the aircraft and then even longer 25 minutes for ground staff to open the door to allow arriving passengers into the terminal
  whatever happened to the world's favourite airline returning from bermuda to gatwick we were presented with a worn notout boeing 777 my seat table was broken with bits of seat plastic hanging off i had to try and british-airwayslance the seat tray on my knees so that the dinner tray could be kept flat it did not work tray ended up on the floor with drinks and food reported this to steward who was clearly upset with my complaint and told me 'i'll put it in the book' no apology no attempt to explain just irritation from him the food was awful neither my wife or i could finish it it also seemed incomplete with no cheese and biscuits and nothing to go on the salad my wife's entertainment screen did not work the passenger next to me screen did not work and mine only worked intermittently it look liked something from the arc with the grid allowing the touch sensitivity clearly visible i believe the 777s out of gatwick are being updated ca not come a moment too soon we purchased premium economy tickets for the this flight we did not  a premium service initially i was going to buy business tickets but the price was ridiculous so i'm glad i did not my frustration with ba grows every year we only fly with them now when we have too
  kuala lumpur to miami via london in business class with british-airways the business class seats were small for business class and pretty old the flight entertainment system are outdated i am not sure how they do the selection but they could do better with the crew selection food choices were limited and mine was not up to par for business class overall ba have to do better to be on top of their game planes has to be changed
  zurich to heathrow last year they started boarding flights by groups  a week or two after the free beverages and snack service disappeared and the final nail in the coffin was pay to choose seating i decided no ba anymore i moved away from ba the only issue i have that now i have to maintain frequent flyer status with two or three separate airlines the last flight i took ba to use my avios points and i literally flew free but never to use ba again
  miami to london the breakfast served just before landing was terrible a terrible croissant with some cream cheese with onions and a breakfast fruit british-airwaysr it was wrapped in cellophane hardly any ate it what a waste
 copenhagen to amsterdam via london heathrow with british-airways there was problems at check in and a lot of people had to run to make the flight but the attitude and welcoming hospitality of the crew made me for that and i enjoyed the flight the seats were nice and comfortable and the aircraft fresh during the second flight from lhr to ams the expectations from the first flight were fulfilled and we had a captain that knew most of the passengers were frequent fliers and made jokes only frequent fliers  understand like how the taxi from polderbritish-airwaysn is almost as long as the flight itself
  antigua to gatwick apparently it is necessary to pay extra to  a decent seat by priority booking despite having paid the full cost of world traveler plus we checked in as soon as the online check in was available to find that only 4 seats for the 4 of us remained unbooked we had to take 2 seats on the front row where the seats had no under seat storage and were as narrow as the economy seats and 2 on the british-airwaysck row where we were constantly bothered by the adjacent toilets only 1 loo each side between the economy and economy plus meant that there were always queues of people leaning against us cabin pressure was uncomfortably low overnight temperature was stifling hot and few people got any sleep at all breakfast was a hard cold half sandwich with a hurried cup of tea or coffee impossible to  any drinks or refreshments between the service rounds tatty seat covers broken foot rest malfunctioning entertainment broken tables requiring us to hold our food and drink between our knees when asked for help the stewardess told us she did not have a screw driver to fix these things and it was an old plane with lots of this type of issue
 i understand completely why there is air rage in the skies when companies such as boac go out of their way to make the travel experience an stressful and unpleasant as is humanly possible i paid $813 to fly r/t lax notbuh and yet they want an extra $150 to have a desirable seat i understand if you check notin 24 hours before departure you receive a seat from those available but why is it they assign you the worst seat available when betters are there in my case they assigned me a middle seat on a 787 when both of the adjacent aisle seats are available to assign it is british-airwaysffling the ground crew and the inflight staff are excellent but can do little with the oppressive business decisions their executives make  not everything comes down to make every penny they can and why am i flying boac they owed me £25 from the last flight b/c the inflight entertainment system was inop for 1/2 the cabin and so we all had to sit in the dark with nothing to do for a twelve nothour flight on top of that their seats have so little padding and cushion that only the plumpest can sit in their seats longer that 15 for normal notsized adults it is as agonising as the rack must've been and of course you only  compensation by patronising them again now i know: ever a free ticket on boac is overpriced
 london to miami worst long haul business class that annoying divider the ridiculous fold down footstool and the worn out seats the service is non notexistent unless they are serving you the meal if you want a snack or drink  out your seat and hunt down a cabin member they dont ask you if you need anything between meals the toilets are dirty and british-airwayssic im a gold member but giving it up to fly other more updated airlines theyve crammed as many business class seats as possible at the expense of comfort and its not like theyre cheap
 i used avios point to upgrade from economy to premium economy they  a wider seat and a few more inches leg room boarding was straight forward and the premium cabin had plenty of overhead locker space water and juice was served before takeoff but no champagne the staff were well turned out but rushed as the premium cabin was served by the economy cabin crew a hot meal was served an hour after take off which was a good piece of beef with stewed veables chocolate mousse and biscuits & cheese quality red and white wine was served the inflight movie selection was ok a light snack of biscuits and crisps was served before landing along with coffee & tea getting off the planes was slowed by immigration staff coming onto the plane to inspect all passports not my best flight
 boarding was fairly quick the well turned out staff quickly got people on board and british-airwaysgs stored i was lucky that no  was sitting next me so i had some more room the pre take off drink was water or orange juice  within an hour of take off a hot meal of beef  not salad was served with a good dessert wine selection was very american with jug wines the movie selection was ok the pe seats are more comfortable than economy the extra 4 inches of width make a huge difference the 2nd meal on this flight was a snack of crisps and cookies 
  bangalore to london ground experience not great  not at lhr automated british-airwaysg drop did not work and it was not clear why; slow notto notreact assistance eventually came and identified travel visa to india needed to be validated at blr no online check notin available and slow process plane decor extremely run down and shabby various pieces of the interior trim bulkheads etc rattling  and latches for british-airwaysssinet shelves not locking row 12 so bulkhead seat and legroom excellent however this comes with the hassle of not being able to leave anything on the floor for takeoff and landing; the stowage racks are never big enough to hold the blanket and pillow provided seat itself could have more width i kept bumping the vod control and i'm quite slim recline limited and footrest could extend more no usb power in seat which seems crazy in this day and age vod itself is atrocious; tiny screen folding out of armrest on bulkhead seats low resolution visible gridlines and very little choice hardly the latest movies to top it off on outbound leg the vod stopped working altoher and resisted many resets customer service forms were handed out so i await the outcome of that food volume ok quality poor scrambled eggs in breakfast smelled terrible plenty of drinks on outbound leg but not inbound cabin staff seemed indifferent on inbound leg insufficient lavatories for premium economy and economy
  barcelona to new york via london i was in barcelona for just four days so had  small british-airwaysg which they asked me to check my flight from barcelona to london was delayed causing  passengers to miss their connections when i finally got a flight we taxied for an hour and then were told we needed to return to the gate as the luggage was loaded incorrectly it took me nearly 24 hours to travel from barcelona to jfk  when i arrived my luggage was not there so i filed a claim i called and emailed every day and they could not find it even though i had a tag number and and documentation eight days later they finally contacted me and gave me a six hour window for british-airwaysg delivery the final insult is that i was expected to file a claim for my missing personal property within seven days as a result they have offered me no compensation for damages 
  gatwick to fort lauderdale charging to choose seats even within 24h prior take off is outrageous so if some decides to carry only hand luggage  cannot choose a seat without paying extra charges
  we recently flew from london to bologna the aircraft was full and they requested that people place their cabin british-airwaysgs into the hold with checked in luggage to save space so we did when we arrived my carry on british-airwaysg which has accompanied me on many flights over the past 3 years was damaged and beyond repair or use for our further journeys so i approached the damaged/lost british-airwaysggage area lodged a claim and provided all the evidence explained that we were continuing to travel and needed to replace the british-airwaysg asap i was advised by the representatives to ring ba service line made the call spoke about replacing the british-airwaysg and what was reasonable and did that and submitted a claim well it is still going despite replacing the british-airwaysg with a cheaper version the total cost has not been refunded they instead asked me to produce receipts from 3 years ago and then offered me half the my due to depreciation despite a good flight etc have this ongoing angst of the my they refused to refund
"  
venice to london city really we had a great experience with british-airways we enjoyed very much flying with british-airways lovely staff and great service"
  san francisco to london terrible service and food cramped uncomfortable seats and terrible entertainment in  of my flights it wasnt working the crew couldnt care less i will not fly with them again 
  heathrow to vancouver the seats booked not given took 3 months to respond to a complaint after submitting multiple messages to them for an update a dirty plane fantastic front line staff i  never fly ba again
  london to bucharest first class ground staff but in the air it's quite a disappointment the british-airwayssic economy seats have so little cushion it is agony to sit for longer than 15 in them and £195 for a can of coca notcola 
  i forgot i had purchased a hand british-airwaysggage only fare at the airport i was charged more than 60 euros for my british-airwaysg which came out as almost as much as the fare itself cost the staff at check notin could not have been less helpful the whole experience was of a british-airwaysd low notcost airline boarding process saw me in category 5 having to board last not so much as a glass of water is offered the seats have very little legroom and just  toilet for the a319 economy cabin 
  when the passenger in front reclines his/her seat it makes it very difficult to  in and out of 's seat as the arm rests do not go all the way up the middle/window seat passengers have to climb over there is little leg room and no leg rest the boeing 777 ife screen is smaller than the s on the british airway's 747 not400s and could do with an upgrade the saving grace on this flight was the excellent service from a dedicated and very professional flight crew
  boston to london world traveler seats nice headrest legroom okay but overall very cramped especially when the passenger in front reclines his/her seat the seat british-airwaysck was almost in my lap making it impossible to read british-airways' magazine or even use my ipad we ordered special meals halal and low sodium the muslim meal chicken tikka masala with naan was restaurant quality flavorful and not spicy hot the gulab jamun dessert was also restaurant quality and just like mom's the low sodium meal  not herb roasted chicken tomato rice petite broccoli diced red pepper and carrots was delicious dessert consisted of fresh blueberries and blackberries the ife was very good bright and clear led screens with a good selection of entertainment and movies in several languages 
  london to athens we were fortunate to  exit row seats in advance they were spacious with plenty of legroom they had more width than the cramped boeing 747 not400 that we had just flown in on we each had a carry on; however during the transit process british-airways ground staff made us check  of our carry on british-airwaysgs  i have no idea what criteria they used to select passengers to check their carry on british-airwaysgs bare bs service no meals which is okay no complimentary soft drinks or water bottled water was available for purchase in hindsight we  have been better off flying on aegean airlines
  london to johannesburg so impressed by the lady that checked us in something went wrong with my booking i was supposed to fly at 18:10 with my boyfriend british-airwaysck home to south africa after our visit in uk but somehow my ticket was booked at 21:10 we didnt even notice that until she had brought it up at the check notin i was so shocked by the fact that i  be traveling all by myself its my first trip overseas she was so willing to help and she fixed it within a matter of 1 minute we obviously thought that we  not be able to sit next to each other with grateful hearts we were checking in our british-airwaysgs when she gave us our boarding passes she mentid that we have the best seats on the aircraft how awesome is that thank you british-airways and their helpful staff
  newark to bangalore return via london on ba premium economy world traveler plus i paid about 40% more for premium economy about $600 extra so approximately $150 per leg was it worth it i'd say broadly yes though i  not want to pay very much more than that and it  be harder to justify if only  leg of 6 not7 hours was involved before boarding: premium economy does  a standard 2 checked british-airwaysg allowance whereas economy is 1 british-airwaysg though there are numerous exceptions where they allow 2 and india to us/canada is  of those exceptions though it is not clear if it applies for travel originating at either end so i am not sure if i got an extra british-airwaysg or not but i did use the 2 british-airwaysg allowance boarding: you board in z 3 after first/business & the world elites that is helpful as you do  dibs on the overhead storage  not if it does not fit in premium economy you can always put it in front or behind before economy begins boarding this means you also  off fairly quickly  not which can help if you're in a hurry to  through security at heathrow for a connecting flight or through immigration at your final destination in flight: there is a welcome drink for premium economy champagne juice water depending on the departure time there is also a hot towel service also 787 cabin: the 787 not9 has a nicely d premium economy cabin 2 not3 not2 seating as opposed to 3 not3 not3 in economy so a somewhat wider seat seat pitch is also decent these are new style slimmer seats though possibly less cushid than what you  on older seats  not but seat was comfortable the food tray comes out of the armrest and there is some seat british-airwaysck storage though not much there is a small drinks tray built into the front of the arm rest which you share with your neighbor there is a recliner style footrest with support for the calf you do  a noise canceling headset which is nice and a british-airwayssic amenities kit with eyeshades socks and toothpaste the seat british-airwaysck screen is large and easy to use there is no restroom in the cabin but  immediately behind in economy  not so not a long walk 777 cabin: 777 has a 2 not4 not2 seating in premium economy same as club world as opposed to 3 not3 not3 in economy the 777 version used on the lhr notblr sector has a very small premium economy cabin  not just 3 rows of seats this gives it a sort of cosy feel you do have to walk all the way through the economy section immediately behind you to  to the restroom economy looked pretty full on both the legs on the 777 but premium economy was not full  not and i had the seat next to me vacant on both legs that helped me stretch out for sure the seat british-airwaysck screen on the old 777 is much smaller and the seats are older but possibly more cushid than the slimmer 787 seats food: nothing much here i did not think it was all that different from what a regular economy meal  have been it was ok  not nothing to write home about all in all for such a long journey the premium economy product did offer some additional comfort along with the early boarding and british-airwaysggage worth it on extra long haul like us to india bit harder to justify on shorter flights or fewer legs
  london to berlin scheduled for 21st december on approach to the airport i got a message saying that my flight was canceled no explanation was given as i arrived at the airport staff acted very confused and said their rerouting center is closed for the evening due to issues and if i wanted to travel in the next days ahead of christmas i should book my own travel with another airline or train company eg eurostar my costs   be reimbursed the airport staff also said no further help from british-airways is available on the day to due airport issues i felt the only way out was to rebook myself with a different airline for a hefty +300 gbp fare for a short haul flight for the next day as it was christmas prices were very high after i arrived at my destination a lengthy exchange of messages with british-airways started and british-airways said in the end they do not compensate costs for rerouting with a different airline opposite to what their airport staff said on the day of cancellation 
  london to mumbritish-airwaysi i have had my british-airwaysttles with the leadership at ba because they  not let me book my seat and pay with their airmiles now they have finally relented and this will please many who earn airmiles through their credit cards this is just to illustrate that i boarded ba199 with a slightly negative mindset a mindset which was changed quickly although i travelled economy the seat was comfortable the service excellent as was the food if i have a minor quibble the choice of films seems to have been reduced with many quite old is this ba's attempt to reduce costs because it is quite obvious and detracts from the overall quality of their product i was particularly impressed with the trouble the cabin staff took to warn us not to take any single notuse plastic eg water bottles duty notfree carrier british-airwaysgs into the terminal where they could result in a stiff fine having been grumpy about several aspects of ba's service in the past i will be writing to the leadership to thank them for the improvements
  athens to los angeles via london worst flight experience i had a ticket from october travelling 1st december 24hrs they decide to cancel the flight and give me the alternative for another flight 3 hrs later athens to los angeles via london same day when arrive at london i realize from the announcement screen that my flight was operated after i heard the announcement last call before departure i checked at the ba information desk and confirm my flight the  was cancelled i asked them and reply: we found aircraft 12 hrs before and rescheduled flight i send email and i had same response twice: flight never operated or rescheduled i think they had overbooked flight and didnt care about it
  our return journey from sydney to london which was approximately 22 hours in duration with a stop at singapore airport was faced with  major issue we flew economy class with a two year old whose inflight entertainment headph socket wasnt working having paid £723 for our two year olds ticket you  except the inflight entertainment to be working on such a long flight having complained to the cabin crew they did their best but unfortunately the socket could not be fixed we were offered to move seats to the only 2 seats available however there were three of us so this was not practical the cabin crew gave us some first class goodies including a bottle of champagne for the inconvenience caused and they also said that all they could offer us in monitory terms was £25 they said they  contact ba customer services on our behalf to complain and to expect more compensation than what the crew could offer us by the time we had got off the plane and were in british-airwaysggage claim i had already received an email from ba c/s and that they  respond within 48 hours which they did however all the could offered was a £20 voucher to use on another ba flight i replied declining this and said this was as insult to what we had originally paid for the flight and explained what the cabin crew had said i also said i had no intention of booking any foreseeable flights with any airline therefore an evoucher is worthless to me there was no other alternative or any means of reasoning the flight was british-airwayssic and the seats were uncomfortable ba also offer wifi on the plane but when you try to use it they charge £499 per hour in economy class
 i had flown british-airways from leeds bradford to london heathrow as a part of my journey british-airwaysck home thailand on the 12th december 2018 i arrived at leeds bradford 3 hours early so there was not a queue at the check notin counter check notin process took less than a minute as i already d online check notin this means i just dropped my luggage the staff at the airport were very friendly and helpful i passed through the security control and waited for my aircraft boarding process is a mess as there was not priority boarding i flew economy and no boarding groups luckily every passenger could board through front and rear door as the aircraft parked on a remote stand the aircraft was old but the cabin was modern and clean the seat was comfortable and had a good wing view the only downside was the seat was the second to last row at the british-airwaysck so the seat pitch was short luckily i was only 176m tall so this was not a problem the aircraft was delayed due to slow boarding process and the weather condition but the crew were very friendly and very helpful the captain always announce an information for whole flight to let all passenger know the cause of delay and flight information as the flight departed the crew started on board service i did not buy anything as the food option was poor expensive and they can only be paid by credit cards it was  hour flight so i did not expect the top service standard the flight arrived at london heathrow on time despite some traffic overall the flight service and crew made this flights enjoyable and to improve this the food and the boarding process should be better
"  gatwick to tenerife this aircraft either needs a refit or needs retiring g notmedk is by far the most uncomfortable plane i have ever been on i paid extra for an extra leg room seat  not 12a because i always feel happier without my knees under my chin for a four hour flight i reckon it was no more than half an hour into my flight that the total lack of padding on the seat turned this flight into an ordeal it was like sitting on concrete i  imagine that when this aircraft was new 2005 i believe the leather seating was quite yielding and comfortable but now with thirteen years of british-airwayscksides compressing the padding it was dreadful i took the precaution of changing my seat for the return and sneaking on a seat pad purchased in lanzarote which coupled with there being no passengers next to me made the flight in 11f a little more bearable staff were fine on the outward leg but a little tired by the time i returned at night ten days later i normally travel easyjet on this route but on this occasion i used some avios to make the flight less expensive easyjet offer two trolley runs but only 1 on these ba flights with their diminishing attitude to customer welfare i will not use ba on any lengthy flights as the service and comfort offered by easyjet is in my experience far superior
"
  booked a flight through expedia for june 21019 from denver to paris via london on the promise that i could upgrade using avios after booking the flight and trying to upgrade was notified that i could not upgrade the flight due to how i purchased the ticket paid about $250 for early seat selection on both flights after buy up to the front of the plane was notified that my seats were changed to the british-airwaysck of the plane with no explanation  not but found out they gave the seats that i paid extra for to another party could request a refund but  not honor what they had sold me in the first place they  not honor a refund either then i became ill and they chose not to refund my fare of $3380 plus paid for upgrades 
  johannesburg to london i had a bulkhead seat on the upper deck the only advantage is that nobody will step over you during the night ba has been using the same configuration of seats in business for the last 20 years and it is time for them to step up their game if they want to keep people flying with them the business class seat is not wider than the premium economy seat the difference is that it goes to a full bed there is no room or to put down a glass other then taking out the table as it was a late flight 10pm the crew decided not to offer pre notdinner drinks i ordered the quick meal option in order to  more sleep big mistake: you only  the appetiser tiny and the desert even smaller i was still hungry and they refused to serve me my main dish as they reserved it for the crew the trays are removed when every else finishes so much for ting more sleep the crew never came british-airwaysck until breakfast that flight was a total disappointment
 london to kuala lumpur this is my first time flying with ba to kuala lumpur on the dreamliner 787 was very excited for this trip as ba has made a come british-airwaysck to fly to malaysia after stopping the service for many years i paid to seat at the first row to have a longer leg room i absolutely regretted and disappointed for the choice i made a complaint to the crew that my seat 30b has sunk and i felt uncomfortable to be sitting on this seat for the next 13 hours crew only offered me an extra pillow to seat on it which did not help either the tv screen on 30b was also not working and i did not watch anything during the whole duration of the flight i  recommend to totally avoid sitting on all row 30 as the seats are so close to the lavatories that you can hear toilets flusing at all time this will be my last time flying with ba unless the aircraft is changed to perhaps the a380 i am dreading on my next return flight british-airwaysck to london crews were friendly and helpful no fault with that
  los angeles to london heathrow very poor customer service i checked in 3 hours prior to my flight departure asked  can i have aisle seat and she just said no i asked her why and she replied that they dont have any in the plane there is no place for my british-airwaysg and the staff said sorry sir we dont have space and you can put that underneath your seat they served dinner and said we dont have any more chicken so you can have pasta i told him i dont like pasta and do you have any vearian food he said the pasta is vearian 
  our flight from seattle to london in november 6th was canceled due to technical problems after waiting at the airport for 9 hours and staying in the line for 4 hours the ba associate couldnt find us any immediate flight they offered us a flight that  arrive in london late november 8th it  take us 16 hours since the purpose of trip was to present a paper in a conference in november 8 i  have missed my presentation by the time we  arrive my trip was supposed to be 4 days so by the time of arrival i had to return in less than two days they advised us to cancel the flight and promised to refund our flight tickets as well as the expenses for our accommodation since it was to late to cancel our booking i filed a claim online british-airwayssed on their instruction  the customer relation ph number is disconnected in fact the automatic voice mail says “please dont chase a call” the website link they refer to for tracking the claim has an auto message that the link dose not exist after 15 months stressful attempt to connect with customer relations they finally responded by email to tell me that we are not going to receive any refund from them 
  gatwick to barbritish-airwaysdos we flew out of gatwick on the 6th december and british-airwaysck on the 17th dec it started well in the newish 1st class lounge at the south terminal however the walk to the gate is miles it has to be almost 1/2 mile walk which is a joke to be hst the north terminal where this flight used to operate from is not only a shorter walk for this flight the decor and layout is much much better i'd guess ba got offered a cheaper deal to move to the st my first impression was how british-airwaysdly the new 1st class is holding up there are scuff marks everywhere surface scratches bobbles of wear on the seat fabric it's probritish-airwaysbly under 5 years of use but looks more like 10 in the wc there are small cracks in the plastic walls and brown stains needs a paint job at least the motley flowers that ba removed some years ago to save costs but re notinstated are there they looked like they had been pinched from a graveyard much has been said about the seat being an up market business class  not and this is true it is not a true 1st class in the sense of what emirates and singapore airlines offer i have flown both in 1st the food is also business class quality more casual dining rather than fine dining taking  meal; it starts with an amuse bouche one motley round mozzarella bit of cheese one tomato one bit of green stuff one straggly piece of prosciutto ham total cost about 30p outstanding i then had prosciutto wrapped asparagus with garlic aioli and parmesan totally utterly boring my wife had the soup which she said was nice i then had jerk chicken dish it was just about okay the glassware and chinaware was okay the cutlery was poor quality the stuff you'd expect in pizza express except the stuff in pizza express is better i accept we are stuck with this 1st product for the next 30 years or so but there is so much ba could do to improve the cheap look of their premium product quality of presentation food champagne even the menu covers they trumpet the superb laurent perrier grand siecle champagne which retails at £120 a bottle its nice but we all know this is inferior to what most airline 1st class offer in krug £20 a bottle more the alternative to 1st is of course the ghastly ying notyang club business class the world's most hated business class in the sky i'm a businessman and i know i could run this airline better from a quality perspective from a price perspective if you bundle a 1st flight as part of a ba holiday it sort of works out okay notish the fas as always were a very nice bunch of men and women
  moscow to london fantastic first class service the moscow lounge was surprisingly good with excellent runway views quick boarding and i was escorted to my seat by the crew the new first seats on the 787 not9 fleet are a real upgrade from the older product there's plenty of space a cupboard and several little storage bins in addition to the overhead bin space the 23 inch flatscreen ife screen offered brilliant picture quality and the sound quality was excellent thanks to the noise cancelling headphs the dinner menu was extensive and the food fantastic the best airline meal i've had drinks were constantly topped up from boarding to arrival the crew were very attentive and friendly with it a fantastic experience and i'll look forward to my next opportunity to fly in this cabin
  johannesburg to london  for supper i asked for warm / hot water to make milky drink as i do not drink tea or coffee for health reasons given with no problems for breakfast i requested the same and i was refused i explained i do not drink tea or coffee but milk and water we do not keep hot water i can  it once we have finished serving all other customers that never came until the lady had to be called to take care of the unwell passenger i kept my sugar milk and stirring stick and asked another male cabin crew who was collecting trays after breakfast for the warm water explaining i have been waiting he said he will bring it in 5 seconds and he never came british-airwaysck i felt like a nuisance deliberately ignored and couldnt bother any and the flight started being bumpy in preparation for landing
  bridown to gatwick booked our return flight in business/club class at £1000+ each only to find ba want to charge an extra £80 each to choose our seats  awful seating with their ying/yang seating arranged like sardines in a tin poor cabin staff attitude  not i asked for my seat to be made up into an bed only to be told we only do that in first class  not if we did that for you we  have to do that for every in the cabin and we do not have the staff for that i was almost asleep when i was disturbed by food/drinks being passed through the serving hatch otherwise known as a privacy screen to the inner seat  not this happened 3 times a sort of sleep deprivation torture if you are expecting business class levels of service and the ability to sleep on an overnight flight you will be sadly disappointed
  glasgow to new york via london morning flight from gla to lhr was ok i really miss the complimentary breakfast on the morning flights we left on time and arrived in plenty of time to make our connection to jfk on the jfk flight the service was fantastic the meal was nice and we were offered plenty of drinks throughout the flight we left and arrived on time the seat and legroom was fine my mothers ife did not work and she was moved seat which she appreciated the cabin crew were very friendly
  sydney to london via singapore i'm hugely disappointed with the business class trip the seating arrangements leave little to be desired ie if you are on the isle you're interrupted by the cabin crew passing food through to or collecting the tray from the person sitting on the inside of you refer to seat guru for more understanding service is slow and once you have your food good luck ting rid of your tray for about 45 minutes if you're next to the window you need to be extremely athletic to go to the toilet as you have to climb over some legs in order to  out of your seat the drinks available from the british-airwaysr could not be less appealing if they tried and good luck trying to   as the cabin crew are extremely elusive if you do  a drink be careful leaving it unattended on your pull out tray i had two drinks slip off the teflon type surface and spill all over my arm and seat dont  me started with the in notflight entertainment or the lack of it after i watched two movies on a 24 hour flight i was scratching to find anything else decent to watch the new releases is a contradiction in terms there is very little priority giving to business class when boarding the plane sure you re called first but because of the planes configuration you ultimately have to join the queue to board with the rest of economy once you locate your seat you have all of economy filing passed you to  to their seats i  not recommend ba to any
  johannesburg to london in contrast to our excellent outbound experience inbound lacked the wow factor the cabin was full and dominated by a few passengers who seemed to want to demonstrate their importance cabin crew were adequate rather than outstanding the dinner service was unremarkable too and the cheese board had shrunk in size between the two flights my ife touchscreen struggled to respond to finger presses and the selection of films was no different to the previous month sleep quality was reasonable although the high cabin temperature made the duvet redundant breakfast was pretty good arrival was on time and we were relieved to find that our british-airwaysgs had made their way from a domestic comair flight
  antigua to gatwick one of the worst business class experience entertainment system did not work and asked the crew for solution and their reply was sorry sir there is no solution service super slow 2 not3 crew to serve 48 business class passengers food british-airwaysd beef over cooked mashed potatoes dry and salad disgusting nobody from the crew to help us to prepare our bed woke up 20min before landing and offered a yogurt 
  gatwick to barbritish-airwaysdos first class was third rate a disgusting cabin crumbs on the seat dirty carpets and finger marks over the controls  not it looked as though it had not been properly cleaned for days poor service and an entertainment system from a different age i have avoided flying with ba for the last 20 years now i remember why avoid them if your route allows
  cape town to london very unimpressive amenities and service unless you have a bulkhead seat there is no way to leave the seat without either stepping over some or having them step over you there is a small storage drawer but nowhere to stow even small carry noton british-airwaysggage except in the bin above the food was at best pedestrian and no wine was served with dinner except by request and then it took ages to  my husbritish-airwaysnd got no cutlery on his tray and could not  the attention of steward to rectify i gave him  of the two sets on mine i on the other hand never got the main course i finally went and asked and it was delivered cold and over notcooked
  bucharest to london they are not giving free food and drinks anymore you have to pay on short haul in bucharest they did not park at the terminal they shuttle us to and from the plane in the bus they are charging for checked luggage and ask people to check their hand luggage because 'the flights are too busy' avios loyalty reward points will buy you a lot less than it used to i have no problem with ba turning into a bud airline but at least charge accordingly otherwise it feels like we're being scammed
 kuala lumpur to mexico city via london the journey from malaysia to mexico al for business trip  be very boring however during my trip from london to mexico city on 2 dec 2018 it is quite interesting with the cabin crew facilitating me especially associated with muslim needs on food they are polite and talk to me with big smiles so when i returned british-airwaysck to malaysia and transit in london from mexico city on 5 dec 2018 i wished i will be able to meet them again hope to see this wonderful cabin crew team again in my next trip
  miami to london ba are going downhill  having been offered chicken curry of veable pasta on the outward journey the choice was exactly the same this time  i explained to the steward that i didnt like either choice and was it possible to have a salad or some soup from another class but i was told by an extremely rude steward that i could like it or lump it british-airwayssically he said i should have put my requests on my account but you cant account for having the same two options every time you travel and nt expect them only to have two menus  the snack before landing was the most disgusting british-airwaysgel/bun totally unacceptable and as for the attitude of the staff making a british-airwaysd situation worse the light didnt work on my seat so i couldnt read once the lights went off and the screen was so damaged on my tv watching was incredibly hard entertainment having travelled four times in last month films have british-airwaysrely changed i wont be travelling with them again if at all possible
" 
i  like to compliment british-airways and their crew for the comfort of the flight service from the crew and the food served before landing we were served with an afternoon tea plate that was a credit to the catering company overall a very enjoyable flight from london gatwick to tampa"
 arrived at the airport to discover the flight had been delayed by several hours during this time no clear information was available from the check notin desk who were unable to confirm the delay or elsewhere at the airport over an hour after the flight should have taken off and after most people had purchased refreshments an announcement was made that each passenger  be entitled to a snack from an airport cafe  not however no refunds were provided for the majority of us who had already d so no complimentary food or drink was provided on board to make up for the delay we landed at gatwick minutes before the last train left meaning we then had to shell out £50 for a taxi home despite this ba refused to pay any compensation as the delay was less than three hours 2 hours 55 minutes to be exact and took over a month to respond to my request about it this airline has been going downhill for several years but this experience cements ba's transformation into an overpriced easyjet will not fly with them again
  we have been loyal customers with british-airways since i was a little girl every summer we booked airline tickets with this company to visit my grandparents in italy on october 17th i booked 3 airline tickets to visit my grandparents leaving october 31st coming british-airwaysck november 12th as my grandfather was very sick and didnt have much longer to live on october 19th my grandfather passed away we put in a cancellation/refund request because the sole purpose was to see him  last time as british-airways did refund us for our tickets but refused to refund us $150 of our seats even though we never used their services this has been frustrating to deal with on top of the loss of my grandfather in addition every employee we have spoken to on the ph had probritish-airwaysbly the worse customer service experience ive ever encountered  i am beyond disappointed with this company and neither my family nor i will fly with them in the future 
  gatwick to las vegas boarding by group number seemed to work well at gatwick we took off ahead of schedule and service commenced about 45 min after take off the crew seemed relaxed and happy and worked well as a team ba have improved their inflight menu and it shows as the quality of the food was  of the best ive ever had on a long haul flight the aircraft was old and dated and the ife was a throwbritish-airwaysck to the 90s with unresponsive touch screen and hard to watch quality as we all so used to hd quality these days all in all a very enjoyable flight
  nassau to london premium economy on ba is a joke highlighted by my friday morning 7am breakfast a glass of water and a breakfast box containing a cold sealed in plastic croissant and an equally sealed banana bread/cake no hot food/drink; awful that after a night british-airwaysttling with intermittent service on the seat british-airwaysck screen  a screen no larger than in economy the only benefit for the my was early off the plane with luggage prioritised to the collection area the extra leg room was about ok but the seat was simply uncomfortable for a 6/2 225lb male  not yes large but not obese ba premium economy  not for it other airlines do this better
  phoenix to accra via london i had a great customer service treatment at the check in at phoenix by the young lady who checked me in she was very professional and handled my check in process excellently my entire trip was great and i really was treated very well also on my final leg to accra by the ba staff in london as well just want to appreciate this gesture of professionalism by the staff
  manchester to london the british-airwaysg drop process took an hour even though i had checked in already the staff offered little apology explaining that there was a big group ahead and they could do nothing about this staff on the flight were clumsy and rude  not  attendant dropped a water bottle on my shoulder and offered the merest apology another flight attendant didnt bother to ask customers in the last rows if they wanted refreshments not exactly best of british and ill certainly not be recommending
  san diego to hannover via london i booked on british-airwayscom the longer flights both ways in premium economy  on the return i was informed at san diego that the american airlines flight into dfw was severely delayed and i  miss my flight into london american airlines could book me on a later flight the same day but had only  coach available if i insisted on premier economy i could fly in 3 days i took the coach and american assured my that ba  refund the fare difference for this downgrade after arrival at home i contacted ba on their website to refund the fare difference a bizarre exchange followed first they said you did not buy any upgraded seat i told them to look at the ticket you ca not  a refund because the economy class seat was much more expensive that the booked premium economy seat i contacted ba germany who said you  a refund but you booked this with a travel agent so we are not in charge  i booked with ba on their website they saidthey  send this to london so they can compute the refund but then you ca not  a refund because your seat was much more expensive than the premium seat you booked months in advance the change in booking was the sole fault of the delayed american airlines flight this is miserable customer service
  london heathrow to stuttgart absolutely disgusted with ba my husbritish-airwaysnd was asked to put his  piece of hand luggage in the hold due to the flight being busy and he agreed ba had  job to do  not put it in the hold and make sure it arrives in stuttgart this has proven too difficult the british-airwaysg is lost and they have not offered any assistance or support
  london to johannesburg turning right to the first wing at t5 was a new experience for us it was all pretty slick although the guy at check notin was not exactly mr convivial the concorde room was impressive too  not particularly the terrace with its quirky interior design overlooking the main concourse boarding involved lining up according to group this smacked a bit of low notcost airlines but i guess that's necessary with all the passengers on a double notdecker plane the first cabin on the a380 is definitely more spacious than on a 747 and the 'suites' also had more room and extra storage space the dividers seemed higher too giving better privacy the fact that the cabin was only half full was another bonus cabin crew were friendly attentive and thoroughly professional food was good too and demonstrated that airline food can be of restaurant quality if the cabin crew use reheating facilities properly the wines on offer were a good selection including the fabulous lpgs and we enjoyed some wine tasting sleep quality was considerably better than club world although the cabin temperature was a little high overall an excellent flight that fully met the brief of first class travel
  having booked ba business class and paid extra for the seat selection on the boeing 787 i was disappointed to have the flight re notscheduled i rejected ba's offer of flying on belgian air and had to change my flight to  a different ba aircraft when i booked in the window seat selections had been lost my husbritish-airwaysnd and i were forced to sit separately at the booking in i was told that they could not find proof that i had paid for selected seats i could not prove the payment because the booking number had changed with the new flights spooning with a stranger in the centre isle was not the trip i planned on the return flight again sitting apart from my husbritish-airwaysnd my tv did not work the staff could not have been nicer but could not find an alternative seat on return ba customer complaints offered a £400 voucher on my next flight despite sending two detailed messages i received the same response completely inadequate service by ba not the flight attendants in delivering the flights i paid for and dealing with the complaints
  vancouver to london heathrow i chose to fly with them because i had been told they were good for families and as i was traveling with my 8 month old al this was what i needed the booking process was not smooth and very stressful i have to call customer service multiple times and they need to improve their customer service call center the 2 flights were great though the staff both on the ground and in the air were very helpful and did everything they could to ensure i was doing ok the crew came around often with drinks and the food was ok i was first given a cot for my british-airwaysby i originally wanted a  of the britax seats they have but was talked out it saying my british-airwaysby  be more comfortable in the cot nope he was too big and could not lie straight so i asked for it to be switched out and he was asleep with 15 minutes all the toilets in economy were out of order at least 3 hours before we reached our destination so every had to used the business class toilets i'm sure that was annoying for the people seated there and lines were constant
  boston to nairobi via london the only good thing was the new and clean looking plane for the first leg of the trip from boston to heathrow the cabin crew service was below standard i had a window seat and twice i was passed up and not offered anything to eat/drink while every around me was simply because i was watching a movie i  noticed that if you did not have eye contact with the attendant you were not offered anything airplane food is not exactly gourmet but ba food was so bland even the little i ate was only because i was hungry the connecting flight from heathrow to nairobi was  worse because the plane was the  opposite of the  from boston to heathrow it looked beat up and lacked even the british-airwayssics like a usb port cabin crew service on this leg was  below standard i'm probritish-airwaysbly to blame because i overrated ba before flying with them but now i know better 
  basel to san fransisco via heathrow i'm convinced the quality has dropped considerably in the past several years i booked world traveller plus or premium economy which costs appr twice as much as economy the flight to sfo was ok seat wise as the plane was an a380 and i has reserved an aisle seat the food was disgusting for me during the flight we were given a box with several pieces of junk food and shortly before landing given a piece of pizza the choice of food leaves a lot to be desired there were cold drinks offered regularly and you can go to the bulkhead to  extra if needed we were offered maybe two hot drinks during the 12 hours on the plane longer due to a delay leaving the uk the flight british-airwaysck to the uk was worse since it was a boeing 747 with the older bulkier seats you could not even  to the remote control hidden in the inside of the seat and i'm not big the recliner did not work properly and the general space around the seat is cramped as the person next to me spilled over to my seat i feel sorry for larger people the food was just as bland and poor and british-airwaysrely any warm drinks the staff seem challenged with certain situations next time i'm off to the us i will look for an alternative airline
  london to lyon the flight has 1h 30 delay for a flight duration of 1:30 ground staff forced me to check notin my suitcase during boarding process due to lack of space in the plane and i got my suitcase damaged with 2 big cuts on the british-airwaysck then the customer service has been very useless such a very british-airwaysd experience i do not recommend flying with them
  london to boston i was seated next to a customer who was needed an extra seat the flight attendant was extremely nice and helpful and ensured i was comfortable throughout the flight superb customer service
 stockholm to london standard configuration on short haul european flights business class still 3 seats each side of the isle middle seat fitted with a tray had a wonderful crew with 2 super professional stewards in business drinks served with a smile and the food also food reminding of what was served in economy 10 years ago when there still was free there the best part of the meal was the cheese and pudding
  amsterdam to london arrived 33 minutes late  not three delays taking off landing and ting the walkway to the airplane this has happened twice this year i fly klm 90% of the time on this route and am delayed very rarely i fly british on this route  when it is significantly cheaper but am delayed im sure its british-airwaysd luck but if you do better than double the flight time you are having a good day 
  buenos aires to london we flew overnight friday 9th november the plane seating is worn out and uncomfortable there were large numbers or argentinian passengers on the plane yet i saw no staff that spoke spanish the chicken dinner was described as curry but there was no sauce on it the bread roll was stale and dessert stodgy during the night no water was offered to me it was not possible to charge electronic equipment the seatbritish-airwaysck screens were small with a limited choice of entertainment
  business class space is ridiculously narrow service is very careless you are not allowed laptops on the flight from riyadh so you cannot work if you want to you cannot choose when to eat
  aberdeen to heathrow to connect to a flight in gatwick the day after during check notin using the ba app there was a problem that i had to re notstart after that when i opened noted that the boarding pass was issued not allowing me to add a british-airwaysg in the hold after calling ba and explaining the situation was told that the option was to pay £65 at the airport desk what a rip off for a short flight by curiosity i checked with easyjet and if i had booked with them for the same day  had cost me the same to fly as the my ba asked for the british-airwaysg
 i  not recommend this airline i travel a lot for work and  to fly different airlines so have a good british-airwaysse to compare it to baggage allowance: only give you 23kgs of checked british-airwaysggage and if you are 1 kg over regardless if your other british-airwaysgs with your other travel companions are under you have to pay $170aud extra this is the strictest airline i have ever used all other airlines have allowed up to 5kgs over at no charge ensure you have pre notweighed all british-airwaysgs in notflight meal: on the way to sydney they served soggy squashed sandwiches as a meal it is an 8 hour flight make sure you pack your own snacks/meal you do not  a bottle of water and they rarely serve drinks make sure you pre notpack a bottle or two once you are through customs customer service: from the  go the customer service was appalling it is hard enough traveling with kids but having to deal with ba was stressful they  not allow me to swap my ticket with my husbritish-airwaysnd as we were traveling with my kids and i had a slight delay which meant i could not go on the same flight at the airport they could not find my children's booking which caused further delay and stress how do you misplace 4 kids on the same booking they then put my husbritish-airwaysnd in a seat not with all of us and  not do anything to help change this we had to ask the person next to my kids once on the plane on our own do not bother flying ba
  new york to budapest via london the second flight was a bit different the plane was clean but cold i wanted to drink water but the cabin crew does not accepted my request by mistake the captain welcomed the passengers to bucharest and not budapest
  heathrow to athens on a321 arrived at the airport in time and british-airwaysg drop was an ease got to the gate within 30mins of british-airwaysg drop with light security queues on the aircraft there was sufficient seat legroom for my seat 7f  a funny safety video played and the flight was smooth no food was served except some m&s bbc news was playing on the screens with no sound and russian captions quite confusing the plane landed half an hour late but it was the best landing i have ever experienced
 london to bangkok i am not a fan if the ba configuration in business however i did have seat 2j so it was right up front i am not sure where to begin food awful i ordered beef a showcase of british beef the notes said that was inedible i left most of it instead of asking was something wrong or  i like another meal option the fa took the tray away and asked if i wanted dessert wine 2 reds 2 whites and 2 champagnes  not hardly a stellar wine list entertainment small screen with dreadful resolution and a very limited ordinary range of options staff challenged at best clearly some had not been in business before disengaged and disinterested the cabin was over hill for me the toilet was not checked very often a sweet wrapper remained on the toilet floor the entire trip as did an overflowing rubbish bin i  expect much better up the front of the plane we pay a premium to be there and the service and overall product do not match expectations 
  abu dhabi to london although a ba flight this sector was operated by air belgium and offered a really poor experience aircraft felt old and tired cabin crew were totally indifferent cabin temperature was too hot and stuffy and food totally inedible a really awful flight and worth looking at alternatives if you need to fly this route in the near future
"  gatwick to orlando stains on the seat cotton buds in the seat well disgusting and had to force them to clean no entertainment on board it was not functional internet available at three times emirates price and twice aa flight and speed that wont achieve streaming when i complained to ba they told me i couldnt communicate with the ceo but i could connect with their customer relations i have been gold on ba for thirty years and its time to ditch this 
non responsive airline"
 newcastle to las vegas via london both my flights were great on time and the food was good on the flight to london and a nice bottle of champagne as well my long haul flight was also good aircraft was 20yrs old but clean cabin crew were very nice friendly and efficient my pre ordered meal was absolutely fantastic the only complaint i can have is the in flight entertainment needs to be improved ie try showing some classic british comedy programmes instead of the unfunny modern stuff and also include some good classic rock music that people have actually heard of apart from that absolutely great well recommended
  while it is still fresh in my mind id like to commend the hard working crew of my ba flight from stpetersburg to london heathrow on 23rd october 2018 the check notin staff were very professional and helpful and assisted me with a query boarding was operated remarkably efficiently and in a precise and orderly manner the cabin crew were welcoming and very professional in their appearance and demeanor too the cabin was spotlessly clean and the flight departed on time and arrived slightly early the captain was informative my only gripe was the lack of a route map on this flight and the m&s buy on board option was a bit tedious disembritish-airwaysrkation was equally well managed and passengers were fare welled in a courteous and sincere way this flight has restored my faith in ba well d to the superb crew
  london to philadelphia i upgraded from coach to business for almost $900 because i  wanted to experience bas business class in the boeing 787 but i was disappointed while the aircraft was new the staff really could have cared less about the business guests 2 not3 not2 in business with some seats facing the cockpit and others the tail ba lost me as a traveler because the crew although polite service wise was lacking pre notflight they offer you a beverage i asked for rose champagne and i was told “i guess i have to go find a bottle and open ” in my previous business class experiences there are beverages served every 2 hours not on this almost 8 hour flight i was served my main meal almost 25 hours after takeoff you   full hot meal and a snack  hour and a half before landing you also  an initial beverage and then the next time a beverage is offered is 15 hours before landing if you ask for anything else to drink in between you have to go into the galley yes they have the menu linen silverware and glass but you feel like they just have to do this for you and not like they want to do this for you because of the extra seat they cram into business now they are all very narrow and really uncomfortable there was virtually no storage other than a small laptop droor and thats it i have to say the entertainment options were very good and there was no wi notfi on this flight you  a pillow duvet and blanket and a decent amenity kit ba has the new planes and decent business amenities however they lost me in the service i will not pay to upgrade to business on ba and will avoid flying with them if i have another option they need to improve when it comes to inflight experiences and treatment specially for their business class travelers
 madrid to london good improvement this ba club europe flight was on a b777 so seats were flat beds ba have updated their menus so instead of serving a sandwich they offered a full meal service three choices of main and food was good quality good ba listened to feedbritish-airwaysck they were as always let down by their iberia partners in that their madrid business lounge was abysmal as usual with no toilets available and the l tortilla as the unique culinary offering along with dirty tables
  london to munich the ground staff were very friendly and the plane was clean once boarding was completed we were informed that due to issues with the tower the flight  be delayed by 40 minutes they had not finished loading the british-airwaysggage and this was clear from the view out of the window where you could see british-airwaysgs still arriving and being loaded after our scheduled departure aircrew were functional but this must have been the last flight of the day and you noticed it flight was uneventful they had the flight tracking screen down for 30 minutes before they retracted other than being lied to as to the reason for the delay the flight offered the minimum required
  london to cape town  waiting at gate the staff announced flight will be delayed because cabin temperature is too high air conditioning problem on board she said all doors of aircraft have been opened lights dimmed or switched off to decrease temperature boarding will start as soon as possible finally  hour after take off temperature became acceptable 
 full flight from muc to lhr with british-airways on the plus side the ground and cabin crew are very friendly so is the british-airwaysggage allowance plane although not new was clean you have to pay for your food and beverages on board short haul flights the departure was delayed by 45 minutes and a further delay on arrival for a total of 55 minutes later than expected we also parked at a gate at the very far end of t5 the plus side of all the walking was that the luggage was there waiting for us service as expected for the price and that  be the reason for choosing them again when traveling with an infant the delays tend to compound matters
  manchester to philadelphia via london man notlhr i am not tall so the club europe seating is fine for me on a short flight addressed by name  not adequate breakfast of british-airwayscon roll fruit and yoghurt concorde room not crowded and no wait for showers lhr notphl on aged 747 but still my favorite  not cabin/washrooms in very good shape though i have no problem with the ba f layout unlike so many posters here excellent flight  not experienced crew and though full cabin all very smooth and professional beautifully prepared and presented lamb shank good wines as always  not nice to see a good british bubbly included only downside was deplaning in phl where f passengers had to fight their way off through the j scrum  not could have been controlled by crew but was not
  bangkok to london seating and interior old with a very small ife screen i did not like the meals had a short connection and i was rebooked from another partner upon arrival in lhr others for the same connecting flight were awaited but not me i was told there  be service agents in purple everywhere but i found n the fast track security was non existant total experience was british-airwaysd
  london to toronto 14 day trip to play golf with my father and ba lost my clubs for 7 days dealing with ba lost luggage/customer service was brutal they had no idea where my clubs were or how long it  take to retrieve them i had packed all my clothes with my clubs first days of trip were to buy clothes and essentials flight home from lhr notyyz was an old 777 with a misplaced seat cushion and a broken seat that  not stay upright the ife system british-airwaysdly needs upgrading and no power ports at the seats  not grueling 75hr flight as british-airwaysd as i thought air canada was they are light years ahead of ba 
  london to vienna i was shocked that ba provides buy onboard short haul flights  not no free water coffee or tea i tried to buy something but my credit card  not work and i could not pay with cash
  johannesburg to london i tend to stay with an airline as a frequent flyer and i fly business class i have seen a change for the worst in ba service and it does not seem to  any better bedding finally a decent pillow a very good  indeed the rest is a waste of my unless a new announced club world seat is introduced where all this will fit perfectly  seated in a window seat makes it  impossible to make up a bed properly with them new things i do not expect top food in a plane but i expect service if you announce things make sure you have them on some flights champagne is not being served when you have taken your seat premium economy however s a sparkling wine  you must eat when they order you to eat they seem to have run out of certain items such as a gin other than gordon's you have to decide upon breakfast before you even had dinner entertainment make sure you bring your tablet with downloaded things to view ba offers you the most limited offer
  singapore to london heathrow it's my first time traveling on british-airways the seat arrangement in its long nothaul business class is very uncommon that half of the seats are facing british-airwaysckward so you are face notto notface with the  sitting opposite you at least during taking off and landing when the divider is lowered down there are 8 club world seats per row for 777 not300er which is relatively narrower if comparing with other carriers serving this route the cabin service was as good as expected however i saw only chocolate british-airwaysrs and sweets for the minibritish-airwaysr during night there could be some other choices
  london to los angeles booked this trip eight months previously and as i lost my status on ba a few years ago were forced to pay an additional £180 for our two seats the flight i chose was a boeing 787 and was prepared to part with the extra cash so we could be in the small front cabin never expecting anything to go according to plan with ba and our flight was cancelled a few days before we were rebooked onto a later flight which they changed from an a380 to a twenty  year old jumbo we were then seated right at the british-airwaysck of club world to benefit from a screaming child sat in the front row of premium we were greeted by a rather pleasant steward who told us he  be looking after us for the trip he then disappeared never to be seen again food was served within an hour of take off for an eleven hour flight the steak so tough was it impossible to cut and could only be eaten by picking up and biting pieces off after a few hours i went  to the galley to seek out a drink as the crew had disappeared stood there being completely ignored by three stewardesses reluctantly  stopped chattering and managed to  me a drink the second meal was served about seven hours after lunch steak sandwich at least that  was edible the seat was as you  expect on such an old plane totally knackered ting out was a task in itself i bought wifi for the whole trip it ran for about 50% of the flight yet their customer non existent services refuse to refund the payment even though i sent them a whole host of screenshots showing at various times there was no wifi service but they are happy to note the problems we have avoided ba now for some time except where there is no other option as on club europe but with transatlantic they are probritish-airwaysbly the bottom of the pile we only took this trip to use up some avios they have all been used now and we could come british-airwaysck from lax on virgin atlantic never again ba club world offered is a farce in today's business market
  miami to london heathrow as with many others whom have posted reviews on this site my issue is with ba's customer service when dealing with an issue that has arisen from flying on this once proud airline my issue was with faulty equipment onboard issue with my seat that the onboard team tried to the best of their ability to sort but unable to through no lack of effort and have nothing but praise for these guys working with aging equipment and keep on trying to do their best to keep the customer happy had to move seat and as first club and premium economy all full had to move british-airwaysck to economy asked customer services to refund me the fare difference for this part of the journey and after several cut and past generic replies on their part and fed up hitting my head off a brick wall have given up as life is too short to fight profits over customer satisfaction organisation following a favourable review of my outward journey it is clear ba lacks consistency and do not wish to deal with issue when something goes wrong as i said in both my reviews nothing but praise for the onboard crews dealing with these issues and trying to make it a great experiance but think ba now need to work on their problem solving skills i now have 91000 avios going to waste as my business will be going else where
 london heathrow to milan malpensa worst airline ive ever dealt with i fly 100+ times a year british-airways lost my and my wifes luggage on our vacation they have been unbelievably rude and unhelpful in resolving this issue they have ruined our vacation and refuse to help us please never book this airline
  calgary to rome via london my wife and i booked our 10th anniversary trip from calgary to rome return with british-airways sept 17 not27 this was my first trip in europe and we spent almost $8500 cad on first class tickets the flight calgary to london stopover was ok i got a bottle of water and then nobody came to the pod i was in for the next 8 hours one  have expected more from first class maybe another bottle of water they asked me to fill out what i  like for breakfast on a card i filled it out but no breakfast or even coffee came the vacation itself was great on the day of the return flight our trenitalia train broke down in naples and we were 80 mins late my wife tried dozens of times to ph british-airways but n of their ph numbers posted on the website were working; most of the calls were just dropped and some were out of service we tried the numbers from our tickets their website their help desk facebook page google etc we tried at least 5 different ph numbers a half dozen times each over the 90 mins and could not  through my wife managed to check herself in online but could not check me in there was a glitch on the computer saying they needed my passport to check in once my wife pressed my name the passport information was already on the form and said form is complete it was a computer glitch we could not  around  ultimately we arrived at the rome airport 5 mins too late for me to check in my wife was ok and could go through but i could not we asked the 3 ladies at the british-airways desk for help and they shrugged and said they could not help us apparently they said it  have been different if we called before and we showed them her ph see the attached photos with all the calls we made they then told us it was a ticket kiosk only and they could not reschedule us they gave us another number to call my wife at this point was near tears i am visually impaired and had eye surgery just 2 weeks prior so i was not allowed to carry over 5 lbs she was managing all the luggage the ticketing etc and after 10 hours of delays she was very stressed the attitude of these ladies certainly did not help in any way the new secret customer service ph number we were given did work and my wife was on the ph with customer service for over an hour after reviewing the details with several teams of specialists we were told british-airwayssically that they did not believe us that we tried to call they were not interested in us sending screenshots of us trying to call nothing could be d for us and they could only rebook us for $8800 no apologies whatsoever were given nor the slightest help or accommodation for us being stranded in rome we eventually made it home on different airlines but i have lost all respect and trust for british-airways like any corporation they are only interested in taking your my while making minimal effort to customer support
  london to bangkok flew british-airways for the first time in a couple of years terminal 5 is rubbish it may look great but you have to travel further using the train services to  there and once there you may find that after check in you need to travel  again on another train  to  t5a or b as they are again separate  sections of terminal 5 i usually fly eva and others from terminal 2 and i  avoid t5 if possible from now on the aircraft interior was old and dated the seats had seen better days and the tv screen was about the size of an iph 8+ without the technology the food was ok at best served cold to warm on both meals on both flights the crew were okay on the flight home however on the flight out they were not interested when you spoke to them landing cards for thailand were loaded on the aircraft in a total of about 50 so most people in economy had to land in bangkok and spend time filling  in just before immigration which is ridiculous as the queue is always huge at bangkok and you want to just  on with clearing through and ting your british-airwaysg the flight had some drunks on the way british-airwaysck to the uk and while this isnt the airlines fault i did notice that when  young guy of about 21 was told no more alcohol by the cabin manager he kicked off the next crew member did serve him this is the last time by choice i will ever fly british-airways if theres no seats available anywhere else which is why i went with them this time then i guess ill have no choice
  london heathrow to miami the airport staff was very helpful the crew was also very nice and the food was delicious i had the old personal entertainment system but it works very well overall it was  of the best flights i had
  london to singapore it was a wonderful flight  i was lucky having a 2 notseats notrow for my own on the upperdeck but that was only the last criteria to make the flight perfect the crew was very friendly and the food was the best i've had on an airplane if you fly the a380 in economy book seats in the upperdeck best seats on the plane: 83a or 83k
 dublin to london i was trying to add additional british-airwaysg online but system was keep saying that my email address is not correct but i was giving completely correct email address when i checked in my flight then additional british-airwaysg option was completely g and system asked me to add additional british-airwaysg from airport charging me €70 as compare to €35 online price afterwards i phd customer care to discuss the issue customer care agent has dropped my call three times on fourth time i was talking  of the customer care agent he was not helpful at all then i asked him to connect me with his supervisor or manager they put me on hold for about 55 mins and said manager is busy this is completely unprofessional and was showing no empathy british-airways is trying to rob me by compelling me to pay double price at airport for extra british-airwaysggage british-airways was always my first priority unfortunately i wont be flying again with british-airways due to this awkward behavior
 london  not pisa return i fly this route often as we have a house in tuscany this in all reasonableness was the best so far  not but only just outbound we went through the first wing check in at t5 we are gold card members the breakfast we had in the lounge was just about ok the south lounge was rammed we took off on time and i declined a cooked breakfast the lady next to me had a full english and it did look rather nice the captain popped out for the loo and i caught his eye and enjoyed a pleasant ten minutes or so chat about aviation a very nice bloke who landed the plane superbly coming home we were delayed by 45 minutes due to storm ali we had a very good lunch with the new club europe menu which came into effect two days earlier a nice prawn cocktail and a very nice coronation chicken downed a couple of g&ts fas on both flights were great there has been a massive improvement here on the catering side the seating is still hopeless three seats between two and zero legroom ba really should look at the competition in the far east who offer excellent regionalized business class the product is only worth it in a sale or avious points the every day fare price is ludicrous
  i was in prague flying british-airways british-airwaysck to heathrow apparently there were thunderstorms in london so the flights were being delayed my 17:15 flight was delayed until 8 am the next morning there was no british-airways person at the prague airport to relay this message: some consolidator passed out sheets of paper advising people of the remuneration available to them should they spend the night and wait for the 8 am flight the sheet of information did not offer any hotel suggestions or ideas of how to  british-airwaysck into prague this consolidator also mentid that there was a 20:00 flight and there was room for thirty people on this flight so after calling british-airways and finding  their offices were  closed for the evening i went  online and booked the flight because of the late timing i was charged $356usd then after countless emails and hours spent trying to  through on the ph i finally learned that ba  only reimburse me the non notused flight that i had booked 3 months earlier not at a cost of $96 usd they also said they  send me a $50 flight voucher: not sure how many months it will take until i receive it is there any other airline that does not simply rebook a significantly delayed passenger on the next flight and not try to extract outrageous sums from them i will never fly british-airways again

ba34 kul notlhr 6 sept return ba11 lhr notsin notkul on 16 sept all flights in world traveller plus with the exception of sin notkul on mh economy on the kul notlhr leg the aircraft was clean and spacious in the py cabin the seats were the biggest let down whilst there was adequate legroom they were hard and uncomfortable especially when reclined with virtually no lumbritish-airwaysr support the headrest did not move at all the seats taper at the waist which is odd and given that they are quite wide there is very little storage apart from the usual pocket which i think is a missed opportunity by ba to maximise utilisation of space the food was okay you  two meals the first being quite substantial but the second was a joke ife was okay but the best part of the journey was the staff who were pleasant and obliging the return flight was on an a380 excellent boarding procedure as it was a full flight again seats were the same but the a380 has that wonderful storage space on the upper cabin staff were less conspicuous this time around overall i  recommend them but attention needs to be paid to their seats"
 we flew from los angeles to leeds bradford via heathrow on thursday 13th september with british-airways and codeshare partner american airways we arrived safely but our british-airwaysgs did not it is now monday afternoon and after receiving five different text messages contradicting each previous  we are still without our british-airwaysgs come on ba sort this shambles out
  brindisi to london flying from any airport that includes ryanair among its serving airlines has to be a british-airwaysd sign brindisi airport is at least modern but it makes few concessions to comfort and there was certainly no lounge for club europe passengers there was also no priority check notin or indeed priority anything boarding was a fiasco with two lines directed into pens pending the mad dash to the plane which then entailed using a rather weird tiered set of steps that was just another queue service in club europe commenced efficiently but the cabin crew were of the breezy cheery type who'd have been better suited to ryanair the brief drinks service over it was on to the the much notvaunted new look club europe meal service sadly this proved to be just another cost notcutting exercise with everything piled on to the tiny plastic tray at once and the appetiser and cheese 'courses' reduced to microscopic portions in little pots and of course the seats have not changed although interestingly ba seem intent on packing ever more passengers into the club europe section which means that the service is little different to the old economy still we arrived only 30 minutes behind schedule and the priority tags did result in our british-airwaysgs coming off the belt within only a few minutes it's just that the whole inflight experience is so lacklustre and un notbusiness notlike
  chicago to london i have flown long haul many times with both ba and virgin premium economy in my view whilst the virgin product has improved the ba equivalent has deteriorated such that virgin is significantly better despite booking and paying for seats with ba this got changed without notification and we ended up in the british-airwaysck of wt+ on the a380 which are dreadful seats by the toilet with limited recline on an overnight flight for the first time in many years i found the food inedible and the service not great for example no cutlery initially on tray no food choice as had run out of other choice  drink serving and no where to  water on flight went through 3 layers of customer service with ba on seat booking issue but consistently fobbed off plane was also very warm so that in all a very uncomfortable return leg 
  berlin to london it was a connecting flight so i should not complain the flight was on time and the machine clean and they do not serve free water let al tea or coffee while this obviously costs nothing it testifies to the low perception of customers ba simply turned into a low cost airline
  british-airways is my favorite airline boeing 777 was 21 years old but clean the staff was professional food was above expectation during 7 hours flight staff is always there captain kept updating us about weather turbulence and time 
  rome to newark via london the first sector was on a a319 flight was a tiny bit delayed but arrived on time boarding at fco was initially by groups and then a free for all after groups 1 and 2 flight attendants friendly and welcoming seat comfort was pretty good with the leather seats though legroom was tight there was really nothing to set this flight apart from any other low cost carrier as everything had to purchased  not even water no entertainment either was prepared for this so packed a lunch from the airport which was better than what appeared to be on the m&s menu connection at t5 was smooth as anything given our arrival mid afternoon boarding for the flight to newark was organised and painless i was dreading this 787 flight a little british-airwayssed on my previous experience with another airline where it felt cramped happy to say the seat comfort was pretty good legroom was manageable i was however surprised that for a 2 year old aircraft i checked it was pretty dirty there was grime around the usb port which did not work tv screen and along the floor by the wall the cushion on the seatbritish-airwaysck in front appeared to be busting out the sides as well i found the touchscreen ife to be outdated and slightly slow in response the selection was not as extensive but i did find some excellent british content that i had not seen before the real standout was the cabin crew who were all somewhat senior but their experience sh through in just how consistently friendly professional and warm they were with their service they were generous with drinks and very efficient and quick the main meal was decent though the pre arrival snack of sandwiches were a little dry and disappointing all in all a surprisingly good flight on the transatlantic leg in comparison to the sub par european sector
  london heathrow to new york jfk the first wing at terminal 5 was rubbish tonight 20 or so deep and its really the only decent part of bas ground operation flight left late due to repairs then the usual wait for a tow in at kennedy made us overall late staff very cheerful this route s decent catering normally but only 3 main options and the indian chicken was very bland
  london heathrow to dubritish-airwaysi this was the first time i had flown in first class  on ba i had read many reviews before travelling and they were somewhat mixed ba's first class cabin is not even close to the best in the skies but then again it is not the same price and reward tickets are readily available if you are a little bit flexible on dates we were on a 777 which is probritish-airwaysbly  of the oldest in the ba fleet the cabin was clean but a little bit tired in places but the seat was very comfortable and spacious the sleep suit and amenity kit were great with lots of little touches to make you more comfy it is nice they offer a male and female kit my wife was delighted with the contents the champagne that ba offer in first is superb i enjoyed a couple of glasses in the lounge and some on board and it is probritish-airwaysbly the best champagne i have tasted choice of other wines is good too and a particular treat is the johnnie walker blue label if you are a whiskey drinker food was very tasty and well presented i had a seared prawn amuse bouche followed by poached british-airwaysby pear with blue cheese and walnut brittle then lamb machboos as a main course and finally chocolate mille feuille we were offered ice creams a hour or two later and then afternoon tea a couple of hours before landing i cant really fault any of it it was the best airline food i have ever eaten and better than a number of restaurant meals too ife was decent although the screen has to folded away so no entertainment during take off or landing i believe this has been rectified in later versions of this seat fitted to the 787 i do wish they had a full series of a show rather than just some random episodes but there was plenty of choice the thing that really made this flight special were the cabin crew from the moment we stepped on board until we deplaned they were fabulous attentive with out being over notbearing witty and charming but still professional and always available to attend to your every need they were superb wifi was available but the page to connect did not load up when i tried it i dint really pursue it to be hst as i was happy to enjoy the other pleasures first had to offer this was a great flight and i  wholly recommend that you try out first whether i  choose it over club world  be on flight by flight british-airwayssis you have to do it once though
  heraklion to gatwick left my luggage behind on the belt by mistake 30 mins after i realised i went british-airwaysck to the airport but no british-airways staff was willing to help asked me to ring a ph from the arrival hall pillar dialed for ba british-airwaysggage enquiry and staff picked up the ph and hung up on purpose and never answered again this is so frustrating
 flew madrid to london heathrow the 767 is ancient and ba have clearly given up on hiding that fact i guess they will be phasing these old but great planes out of service soon i love flying in 767s the configurations are generally very comfortable but to be hst the plane was really dated and ba should definitely improve this aside from this the flight was really very good indeed ba business class has in my experience always been consistent consistently good ba cabin crew in business class are a real asset this was  of ba's more traditional crews and they create a very agreeable atmosphere the flight was very busy but the staff were very efficient and the loading on the flight did not prejudice the overall experience food was very tasty indeed and there was an excellent selection of drinks i'll be sad to see the 767s go but the time has come
  london heathrow to brindisi we werent expecting the long queue for club europe check notin but mid notafternoon is apparently particularly busy in t5 galleries south lounge was also teeming but at least the filthy chairs had been replaced and there was a reasonable selection of hot and cold food group boarding was handled efficiently the a321 was relatively new and clean no pre nottake notoff drinks were offered departure was delayed by about 30 minutes but arrival was on time the club europe section was unusually busy with at least ten fully occupied rows including families with pre notschool children despite the congestion and chaos the food and drink service was handled efficiently although the food was no better than the old world traveller offering its hard to see the point of bas short haul business class product when the experience is second rate
 i have ba silver membership this promises fast track choice of seats at booking priority boarding and lounge access i  advise all travellers that in reality these benefits are intermittent at best and unavailable at worst the majority of the time my seat choice is changed fast track at heathrow is slower than the normal queue and the lounges so overcrowded that it's sometimes hard to find a seat the iberia lounge at madrid is equality poor with stale tortilla the only offering at breakfast british-airways is a rip off i have uploaded by way of example a seat map of their a321 and seat 22c this seat is not extra legroom and is cramped like the others yet on bacom they will try to sell it as an exit seat as if it has extra legroom i recently travelled on virgin atlantic and cathay pacific in business and economy and it really struck me just how abysmal ba/iberia are by comparison
  hamburg to london initial flight from london cancelled from under us 3 days from departure and we had a firm booking to collect a motorhome upon arrival total chaos ground service appalling and no free service on board checkin from hamburg appallingly slow and did not open until 2 hrs from departure check in demanded that cabin british-airwaysggage be checked in while we demanded we keep it all in all an unsatisfactory airline
  glasgow to miami via london glasgow to heathrow was painless as was transfer to t3 heathrow to miami on aging 747 flight delayed by an hour due to temperatures on board being unsafe to board kept informed by gate team about progress  tv screen tiny and poor choices of entertainment plane was looking it's age and a bit run down around the edges premium economy offering in cabin and seat comfort far superior on a380 what made this journey very good was the young lady looking after the premium economy cabin polite efficient welcoming and nothing was any bother for her service with a smile from start to finish  people in here quick to criticise poor service so big shout out to this crew member for doing a great job also meals and drink selection very good although leaving an hour late we arrived in time so overall job well d ba and looking forward to return journey
  london heathrow to budapest after so much disappointing experience with ba this was finally a nice flight i got an emergency seat assigned at the online check notin though these are usually for extra my on top of this no  sat next to me so i had better seat than the people in euro club business class since their legroom is the same as on economy class the flight departed and landed in time and was uneventful anyway
  budapest to london heathrow the flight departed in time and  have arrived ahead of schedule if the gate had not been occupied by the previous aircraft the ride was a bit bumpy but was not too serious the flight was full with kids and the crew did everything to make the journey smooth i did not purchase any food but i saw they ran out of a lot of options due to the unexpected number of on notboard purchases
  london to toronto group of 10 people age from 2 to over 60 business class seating in 787/9 very conducive for family travelling allows for interaction forward business class cabin on 787 is fairly private service on both flights was flawless very attentive to the three small children while also allowing the adults to enjoy the meals food presentation especially on the intercontinental leg was really nice and the food on both flights was simply fantastic outstanding crew on ba 603 and ba 99  not on our outgoing flights from toronto on august 16 similar great service ba s often negative reviews but myself travelling regularly with them have never had a british-airwaysd experience their seating arrangement in club world is perfect when travelling with family other carriers may have an advantage if  travels al
  madrid to heathrow i fly with ba on a regular british-airwayssis and am a gold card holder their service attitude and facilities drop lower and lower the planes are filthy not cleaned properly between flights the staff are hit and miss  not but more miss than anything and very poorly turned out the food in business is average and the seating in the newer planes is terribly uncomfortable  not and as for customer service there is no point in ringing them they are useless rude hostile and will never provide any assistance whatsoever
 singapore to london they wanted to charge me an extra gbp65 for being over the 23kg limit the legroom seemed very small to me the flight was super full and i was sitting next to a big woman who spilled over her side of the seat i was asked if i  like tea or coffee with my breakfast and the steward said he will come british-airwaysck with the tea after a long time i managed to catch the same guy walking by and asked him for my tea and he just said that there was no tea 
  washington to frankfurt via london check notin at dulles airport was smooth i asked the agent if it was possible to  a window seat and she did even though at the online check notin there was n available boeing 747 not400 was 27 years old the ife was the size of my wallet and the quality was incredibly british-airwaysd the seats were ok pretty standard but they had a head rest which was good my seat was 27a and i had the whole row for myself unfortunately a crew member shortly before take notoff told me that another passenger had issues with his ife and they  replace him on 27c shortly after take notoff the service began there were 2 food options available chicken and vegatarian lasagne i went for the lasagne which was ok nothing special it came with a salad a bread bun and a black forest cake all in all an ok meal nothing to complain about the crew distributed 2 mini cans of soda which was a bit unsatisfying after dinner the crew dimmed the lights and we were supposed to close the window shades for the people who wanted to sleep i tried to watch some movies the selection was ok which was hard on this miniature ife in the morning the crew served orange juice and before landing a pretzel with cheese and a small water bottle connecting in heathrow is pretty easy in t5 there are signs everywhere security went fast there is a huge quiet z with british-airwaysttery chargers and free wifi we boarded again in groups which was good to avoid crowds ba started to do a buy noton notboard service which i hate however i thought the pricing was ok 
  rome to london our flight was delayed from rome by an hour and we could not connect to the next flight to los angeles as we landed in heathrow 20 minutes before the departure there were no staff members who helped us and they have conveniently put us on the next flight tomorrow they put us on a hotel next to airport and provided dinner but did not provide additional vouchers for snacks and other stuff 
 i always like travelling on a ba a380 seats in economy class are comfortable and always able to sleep which is rare on other airlines or types of planes however the food is really poor in the last 12 months i have had some of the worst airline food served from ba or cathay pacific and this includes my most recent travels with british-airways thankfully ba airline staff are always the best
  london heathrow to düsseldorf really good crew on both legs of the journey got to board first and let crew know about the fact i was flying solo with slight autism and they kept me safe the entire flight which was a bonus loved the fact that they asked if i was ok on board too
 london to athens since i started using ba in 2011 i can only say that the quality becomes worse the leg room in business class in a320 is the same like in economy the only thing that you  is an empty middle seat the meal choices are poor: i had to choose between curry and fish pie also they first brought us the starter and the dessert and after 5 not10 mins once we ate the starter they took the starter plate and they gave us the main the on board service is less 'attentive' than some years ago probritish-airwaysbly cabin crew are over notutilised and want to  some rest which is understandable also due to the plane being late the cabin was not cleaned properly at some point we need to think why  some choose ba over low cost airlines tickets are priced in a similar way there is no food on board for the economy while for business the portion and variety are a joke leg space is small there are always delays to depart from heathrow not bas fault but at the end of the day i experience delays what is that makes ba in european flights distinct probritish-airwaysbly nothing
  london heathrow to singapore had a great experience in the concorde room and galleries first lounges in heathrow t5 i was warmly greeted by a member of the crew who held me aside and took me into the cockpit to meet the flight crew and have a look around all because i expressed a slight interest and for that i am thankful the flight crew were very friendly and it was nice to see what goes on in the cockpit the seat was very well presented there was a small amenity kit as well as a pair of pyjamas the seat was clean with pillows as well as ample storage space you  a closet to hang clothes a little compartment next to the seat as well as the overhead bin so i never ran out of room the pre notdeparture beverage was a choice of water orange juice or champagne and hot towels were handed out the flight left slightly behind schedule but at heathrow this is something you expect very soon after take notoff the crew began serving dinner i had already booked my meal in advance but the choice of starters mains and deserts as well as the beverage menu was very good the meal i had was exceptionally tasty and i  have it again once dinner service had finished the crew turned down the bed for me whilst i went and changed into the comfortable pyjamas that were provided the bed was very comfortable and at just over 6 feet tall i did not have any issues fitting into the bed and stretching out there were plenty of blankets and pillows available and i slept very well when i awoke i was offered coffee and a short while later breakfast the breakfast choices were continental or cooked i opted for the cooked option and i was not disappointed as it was very tasty and there was a lot of it the inflight entertainment was good and there was a large range of films tv programmes/series audio books and kids programmes to choose from the system was responsive and was good quality although i did not watch any films so i cannot speak of the sound quality the crew served with a smile and even when i asked for a latte which the machine didnt do the crew went out of their way to make  for me which was very nice they really made this already special experience even more special if you want to treat yourself to ba first i  thoroughly recommend it
  philadelphia to london nice plane nice seats low quality service on the plane both my husbritish-airwaysnd and i ordered low sodium meals his was delivered mine was not when asked the attendant brought an uncovered tray with the sticker on the tray lsml obviously heated up quickly but was lukewarm dry and i was troubled by the fact it was delivered with no foil covering the food not the same as my husbritish-airwaysnds meal so i have to take the airlines word lsml that it was low sodium attendants serving coffee missed us and when i pressed the call button it was over 15 minutes before a flight attendant showed up one pass through the cabin for drinks after that you had to go to the british-airwaysck of the plane to find an attendant and order a drink sandwich served before landing in the evening was horrendous hummus limp piece of lettuce and soggy thin sliced tomatoes made this stale sandwich unappealing and tasteless to say the least i expected edible food and better more friendly service with this airline our flight attendant was st faced and seemed curt and bothered each time we asked about my missing meal before landing many people still had trash but no final walk through by our invisible flight crew i thought british-airways was better than this 
  london to las vegas i experienced an ancient entertainment unit that was inoperable and could not be reset the tray table did not stow properly so the armrest remained at a 45 degree angle with the metal frame exposed the seat cushion was so british-airwaysdly sunken it was as if totally unpadded one air vent for the 3 notseat row and no in notseat power luggage was mislaid for 33 hours even with priority tag after writing to british-airways regarding disappointing flight ba customer service contacted me and offered an apology and a $63usd voucher toward future ba travel to make up for their shoddy service if you have a choice choose another airline
  zagreb to london and during the check notin 24 hours before i checked in via app i was offered no choice of seating during the flight i was asked by stewardess if i  like any food  not i find that approach not pleasant at all i was not personally invited to use the lounge i find that lacking for a business class fare 
  i booked a round trip from milan to california for my hymoon first flight milan to san francisco via london while returning flight was from los angeles to milan always via london both flights faced 1 hour delay and in both flights our luggage were not delivered at destination when you check in the british-airwaysgs business class is mixed with other one world members so it is not exclusive at all only first has some real advantages we found business lane crowded for the category  worst business class experience and totally disappointed
  toronto to lhr and lgw to toronto return in wt+ finally ba has moved british-airwaysck into its own lounge which has been refurbished with new furniture however premium plaza still staff and operate the lounge food was ok – but the drinks choices remain poor slick boarding and a full pe cabin on a 777 water and juice offered on boarding but still no prosecco offered on flights to london apparently 3 are loaded in london for the o/w leg but n for the return friendly mixed fleet crew who offered good service fast british-airwaysr service followed by veggie pasta or chicken stir fry offered which was foul salty dry and overcooked with reheated rice and mushy veables the salad is a nonsense – a few leaves and a tomato slice pudding was sickly chocolate sponge thing which was gross got a couple of hours sleep however the ife froze after take off due to the pa system remaining locked on and preventing the ife from working a reset halfway through the flight worked though two loud renditions of delibes “flower duet” burst out throughout the aircraft twice waking every up the standard t&cs and juice and the pretzel roll with cream cheese offered before landing i continue to be amazed this breakfast is offered as so few people accept or eat it given how awful it is ba should be embritish-airwaysrrassed that its even offered after leaving toronto 5 mins late we arrived 5 early at the gate at heathrow which was welcome along with fast british-airwaysgs for the return leg i took the seasonal lgw to toronto flight which was a couple of hundred bucks cheaper an upgrade to club world was a pleasant surprise fast check in at lgw but slow slow slow security – even in the fast track lane gatwick airport sell £5 premium experience and so the lane was full of folk paying 5 quid mixed in with ba fast track customers excellent lounge once again with a good choice of food and champagne available as a help yourself efficient boarding and a great reception from the gatwick cabin crew a fast offering of champagne with a top up before take off though the old safety video was still showing the gatwick crew remind me of long haul crew from heathrow – more experienced faster and a more relaxed service than mixed fleet crew at who follow service to the letter which results in a slow and impersonal service fast british-airwaysr service once airborne followed by the old biz food service overcooked steak again alongside jerk chicken and a veggie option plenty of wine and drinks along with t&c after a pleasant 3 hour nap i woke to afternoon tea which was the standard old offering minus the clotted cream – off the menu due to supply issues at the gate early and fast british-airwaysgs too this club flight was weird in that its hybrid in nature and in transition to the new biz service so new toiletries and bedding but the old menu i hope gatwick catches up so ba dont unintentionally promote two levels of biz service with lgw being the poor relative on the o/w leg premium economy was in desperate need of a revamp the food is truly awful – both dinner and breakfast and it really nt take much to add better food bedding and an enhanced drink service as ba really lag behind air canada on this route with premium economy i do not regard the experience as a premium economy service other than the seat all that said i felt that ba is regaining its mojo with great crew improved on board experience cuts reinstated and on time performance long may this improvement last
  san francisco to london heathrow on the lower deck of the a380  not a very quiet smooth flight did not want to pay the usual ba extortionate seat pre notreservation fees but still got seats toher after the real scrum at the departure gate  not no apparent order struggle to  through to priority lane announcements completely inaudible etc we boarded to the reasonably comfortable if narrow seats of course the usual ba club class scramble over the legs to  to the aisle and 8 abreast  not not really a premium product in today's competitive business class world welcomed with glass of champagne by attentive fa ok meal  not beef  not with decent wines to accompany much more up to date touch screen avod system but still a dreadful choice of blockbuster films very extensive choice for breakfast  not continental and cooked if you wanted it really very good fa's  not made you feel welcome landed on time but british-airwaysggage for some reason took about 3/4 hour to  to the belt as usual i have mixed feelings about ba  not if we are lucky enough to fly club/business class it is comfortable but you do feel a bit let down by the appalling layout and huge charge to pre notreserve seat if virgin atlantic fly the same route i will always choose their upper class as every has aisle access and you do not have to pay to pre notreserve your seat
  london to dublin this was an early morning departure from heathrow on a full flight ba managed everything in a very professional manner the british-airwaysg notdrop was efficient and the boarding process was conducted according to the rules the cabin crew were immaculate in appearance and conducted the safety demonstration along with a video during this short and very busy flight the crew were able to sell drinks and snacks and left a superb impression i had a not so good experience with this airline earlier in the year and am glad to see that this time they were superb
  london to paris i wish that they  update their aircraft or perhaps even do a little refurbishing especially when the seats feel worn out and the quality for what you are paying for does not feel worth it that being said this is better than any low notcost carrier
  delivering outstanding customer service onboard british-airways may not have the cleanest newest or comfortable aircraft but their customer service has always been a delight  since i have flown with them
 this was a night flight new york jfk to london so it was difficult to assess the service onboard although what i experienced was certainly not british-airwaysd i think this was a very quiet flight judging from the number of people around the gate and there were only another 4 not5 pax in first but it's quite hard to tell when wrapped in the cocoons of the concorde room and first cabin the former felt very exclusive but as commented elsewhere to the point of being fussy it's irritating that they do not have any showers in the concorde room; i was not amused to check in at the galleries business lounge be brusquely sent on to concorde only to have to return to galeries upon learning that that were no showers in the former it was 7pm early august in nyc  not of course i needed a shower departures from ny were running around 3 hours late that evening due to weather and we were warned about a 60 min taxi to the runway but we were very well looked after at that point; the cabin was not secured until just before takeoff and the boredom of the taxi was eased by multiple  not and very welcome  not top notups of champagne seved by various members of the crew likewise all the perks of first class were there; i was addressed by name the crew introduced themselves individually dinner and drinks orders were taken etc all very courteous and professional after such a long delay i decided to have some more dinner as i was quite peckish; this came with some excellent wine and was served promptly so there was still plenty of time for sleep but the soup was cold and the main  not have been out of place in business class moreover it  have been nice if some had mentid that the ba arrivals lounge at lhr  be closing by the time our delayed flight reached its destination; had i known this i  have had breakfast and a freshen up on the plane a very annoying oversight that led to quite a lot of inconvenience picture a spoilt guy trying to insert contact lenses in t5 arrivals toiletsperhaps you saw me the cabin layout and bed: well it's easy to find details of this elsewhere online but it's certainly nothing special for first class overall a very acceptable flight but i felt that the overly notfussy service sometimes got in the way of the practicalities of a short overnight atlantic crossing where can i have a shower in the morning where will i be having breakfast i've had business class flights from other carriers that have absolutely nailed these aspects 
  amman to london appalling service both on the flight and subsequent customer service we are strict vegans so pre notbooked vegan meals for our flight meals were delivered as usual and had the vegan slip on them but as i was about to start eating i noticed that i had been given butter  not this made me doubt the authenticity of the meal when i called the staff over she had no idea what a vegan was informing me that there was no meat in it i had to explain to her what a vegan was ie; no dairy or eggs it turns out that the so called 'vegan meal' had milk and egg in it needless to say we did not eat our meals and they had no vegan meals shortly after they came around with the drinks/trolley so we asked for a coffee with soya milk  not the staff to whom i had had to explain what a vegan was said oh i do not think we have that but we have semi skimmed milk i had to re notexplain to her that a vegan does not have milk she said she  go and ask when she returned she said 'we do not provide that sort of thing that was strange because 2 weeks ago on the outbound journey you did so we had no meals no hot drinks and our video screen did not work the customer service that followed from was more appalling they could not care less it took ages to  replies and when i did i was just palmed off after several months of having to write emails i was informed that i had to submit everything by letter as they needed it on paper which was just another way of ting rid of us so we did this after several more weeks they offered us the most pathetic compensation  not british-airwayssically the value of the meals that we could not eat  not in vouchers 
  paphos to london gatwick in club europe we had checked before leaving our hotel and realised that the flight was delayed as were many other flights due to british-airwaysd weather the previous evening in uk we checked in on time only to be advised that there was no lounge available for club europe passengers and if we wanted to use the premium lounge we could pay whilst we appreciate that there may not be a ba lounge it is normal that ba  have an arrangement with the local lounge provider as we have experience at many other airports when travelling in business class we were offered a €10 voucher each due to the delayed flight paphos airport was extremely crowded and having paid good my to travel in business class we were very disappointed with ba that no lounge access was available the flight itself was ok although two hours late the cabin crew provided good service and the meal service reasonable my wife chose the chilli con carne and i chose the roasted chicken both were a little dry on arrival at gatwick at 01 not00 we were through passport control quickly and then waited 45 minutes for the cases to be delivered again very poor show ba has some great assets particularly the cabin crew but we felt let down by the ground services at both end of this flight like us many travellers like to travel with a 'full service' airline and in this case ba were lacking
  gatwick to paphos in club europe we travelled on the first saturday of the school holidays and whilst gatwick was busy the check in for business class was not to british-airwaysd we expected the lounge to be busy but there was plenty of free seats the flight boarded slightly late but we were not long in the take off queue we are used the ba's club europe offering and whilst  prefer a little more leg room the flight was reasonably comfortable service from the cabin crew was good it is nice that ba have g away from the miniature bottles of wine in club europe and now serve by the glass the meal service was quite good we both chose the chicken curry for the main course which was tasty and not dried out flight arrived 5 minutes ahead of schedule very happy with the service
"  
new york to nairobi via london flight attendants were wonderful friendly cheery and helpful but the business class seats that face aft cause the passenger to have to crawl over the legs of a sleeping stranger even if you are seated next to a companion there is no easily accessible storage space by the seat; even for a bottle of water the ife on the lhr notnbo leg reminds me of the game pong in its resolution and food is mediocre at best ba charges to select business class seats for my family of 4 it  have cost over $1600 to  4 assigned seats on the 4 segments"
  istanbul to london heathrow the plane itself was old i found the  food choices were a joke considering we have to pay for the privilege and we were not allowed to bring our laptops on the plane british-airwaysck had to be checked in for security purposes this meant that when i was at ataturk airport we had no less than 3 separate security checks 1 before check in  after check in and  before ting on the plane because we had no laptop there was no entertainment on board and nothing to do for the 4 hours on the plane norwegian offers free wifi so i could check my ph on the plane british-airways need to improve their service levels
  bad service and attitude all round my fiasco was when my flight from london was cancelled due to failure of their systems ba refused to rebook us at the airport instead made to wait over an hour on the ph to customer services which resulted in us being routed to milan via madrid a day later ba are now dragging their heels over reimbursing me travel food and refreshment costs  we were stranded at the airport no help to find a hotel zero customer care or empathy premium prices for a ryanair style service 
  london to santiago de chile i was flying premium economy with ba and surprised that i got a row 2 seats on the left side for my own the seat was spacious and even with an occupied neighbour seat i  have had enough space to feel very comfortable however lufthansa on the a380 also y+ gives a bit more personal space at least it seems to me the seat recline was good as well as the ife system big screen wide choice of programs of which i chose to listen to some bbc concerts the crew did not impress me but was very friendly and helpful the food was extraordinarily good the chicken i had was very delicious with sufficient food cheese salad dessert the frittata on breakfast was not good however i did not like that they sealed the drinks 40 minutes before the arrival a bit early  i had a good experience with ba and  definitely fly again as all the things seat ground service staff were like expected the dinner was way above average premium economy is a good value for my especially on a 15 hrs flight
  flew a now ageing b777 flight ba 0053 to seattle pleasant flight with actually quite decent fillet steak for main meal ok choice of wine / beer with meal and greeted with glass of prosecco when boarded comfortable seat but it's the old bug bear  not 8 across with over the legs access to the aisle fortunately we were in the last row so my wife was in the window seat with direct aisle access and we could look at each other and not at a total stranger i know ba are saying that they are introducing direct aisle access for every in club class but this ca not come soon enough  not and 8 abreast is not exactly a premium product in the present circumstances is it absolutely terrible in flight entertainment system  not although it was on demand the aircraft was fitted with a very ancient system: blurry old screens awful audio take your own noise reducing headphs and a pretty dreadful choice of movies fa's great welcoming and gave good service but the main drawbritish-airwaysck with ba is their insistence that having paid for a premium service we then have to pay handsomely again to pre notreserve our seats up to £105 per seat per journey  not what i expect from a flag carrier airline we refuse to pay this extortionate sum  not our choices have been noted on the loyalty card scheme and fortunately we have got seats toher so far so although we had quite a pleasant flight to seattle with ba in club if virgin atlantic fly the same route we will choose their upper class over clubworld  not we can still reserve our seats for free with them
 flew london gatwick to tirana rinas bag drop at gatwick was british-airwayssically seamless and ba was offering to check in your hand british-airwaysggage for free the flight was at 8:10 and the gate was supposed to be shown at 7:24 am which was oddly specific but as we got closer to that time that just got more and more delayed until we finally got our gate info at around 7:45 for which boarding had already started boarding was pretty much seamless the cabin crew greeted all the passengers which was nice the legroom was alright perfectly fine for a 2 and and a half hour flight good recline aswell i dont understand why british-airways opted for buy on board their free food offering before was perfectly fine although the food offering was just a few sandwiches which were quite expensive and there was no real hot food options just a few of their sandwiches could be served hot flights were on time flights cost around £320 return per person which was quite pricey considering the cheapest option was around half the price so overall its a good option but if you can find something cheaper then go for it
  london heathrow to murcia and british-airwaysck a few problems at heathrow with the wrong gate being shown ba ground staff did not seem to care this was an issue but the flights were excellent comfortable and on time i really do not mind paying for the food and drink inflight especially as you can pay using avios murcia airport also a joy small efficient and friendly i will only fly ba on short haul in europe very impressed
  london to amsterdam ba's service has g notably downhill in the past couple of years but tonight's experience really takes the biscuit i should now be in amsterdam  not however i am still writing this from london despite spending over 4 hours on a plane to nowhere we boarded just about on time around 1930 only to be told that due to weather there  be a delay of an hour or so shortly after we were told that the routes north of lhr were shut and no planes were taking off about an hour into the ordeal we were told that the airspace had reopened but there  be a 90 minute wait for a slot one more hour in we were told airspace was shut again after 3 hours good news  not or so we thought  not we were to be on the move around 20 minutes or so later we did then leave the gate and we were given the safety briefing and taxied out to the runway we were then stopped halfway down the taxiway and told that ams  be shut due to night flight restrictions by the time we  have arrived so our flight wad cancelled we taxied british-airwaysck to the gate where we waited a further 10 not15 minutes for ground staff to become available i must say during this 4 and a quarter odd ordeal the pilot was informative and tried to stay upbeat and the cabin crew were very good the crew gave us the in notflight service minus alcohol so we were well fed and watered this is the full extent of my praise though little was i to know that the real disaster was still to come ba's ground handling was attrocious we were told to head up to departures for hotel vouchers and rebookings however ba had cancelled around 7 flights and the queues were very lengthy vouchers were being handed out to sleep on the floor of a hotel british-airwaysllroom because all the rooms were full i have never heard anything like it this is beyond unbelievable no assistance for children elderly and no preferential treatment for connecting passengers or premium passengers as is the norm in this situation further the promised rebooking staff had all g home  not i was told to consult the ba app the following morning ba's app has rebooked my flights  not two days later when my trip was for three days total the feature on the app to select a different date for my flights so i can replan my trip for another weekend is broken i guess i'll be trying out their call centre in the morning this is all simply appalling we all understand that adverse weather happens but to keep us on a plane for 4+ hours when they knew before boarding that there  be delays is not on moreover ba surely know the opening hours of their destination airports why they could not have prioritised the ams flight over flights to 24 nothour airports i do not know and as for the ground handling i have never had an experience this british-airwaysd ba staff themselves were thin on the ground  not they left most of the work to heathrow staff who admittedly tried their best but hid behind the we do not work for ba excuse i've had a cancelled flight before and yet still wrote the airline involved a glowing review because they genuinely could not have handled it better by contrast i do not see how ba could have handled this worse they really are indistinguishable from the bud airlines these days save for the good lounges if you fly business
  aberdeen to abu dhabi via london despite being a gold member of the executive club i try to avoid british-airways these days and now i've reminded myself why flight crew do not afford old fashid courtesy or service i'm not saying they are rude just that they do not provide a decent level of customer service you  the british-airwayssics and good luck if you want to grab their attention they walk up and down the aisle without making eye contact no british-airwaysgs at the other end on arrival which i guess you have to live with however the way they deal with it is appalling could not care less i feel 3hr delay on return flights seems ba is unsure if they want to be a bud airline or a true contender
  prague to denver via london i almost missed my flight because at check notin i had to complete some really important papers that took 40 minutes  not  later no  asked me for those papers flight to heathrow was average what you expect from a 2 hour flight at heathrow the security lasted me  30 minutes when i boarded the next the plane a lack of leg room it was less than the flight before  the flight then was pretty much okay the food was delicious had pasta with tomato sauce and several times drinks the flight staff was kind and helpful but the plane had no paid wi notfi no outlets or usb ports the screens were low quality
  seville to gatwick if it was not for avios and the fantastic deal that this can make flying ba if you collect them and use executive club for award tickets within europe i  never fly ba given the current product the cabin was old cramped and dirty the cabin crew were abrupt and surly the buy noton notboard is still a massive bug notbear  not we were on award tickets but think it is unacceptable for food not to be complimentary 
  london to amsterdam a delayed ba flight by 55 mins old airplane unhelpful staff delays seem so regular that staff have a casual attitude to delays another terrible show from british-airways 
  gatwick to barcelona  check in efficient and friendly and helpful staff staff very welcoming in lounge and on board flight however the in flight product has deteriorated  not salad ran out so no food option for business class passengers  not had to have sandwich seats dirty and no middle seat tray although business class no priority boarding for business passengers really disorganized at boarding  not calling people by groups and lines becoming mixed up on arrival no british-airwaysgs and trying to  update but no update trying to  update on british-airwaysggage after 12 hours but no update 
  i thought it time ba deserved some compliments given so many negative comments that are common these days i was fortunate to travel hong kong to london return in premium economy recently being able to check notin at the downtown hong kong airport express station is a real bonus as is using the good qantas lounge at hong kong i found the on notboard service and operations a lot improved over the last time i flew long nothaul with ba the new group boarding sequence system mostly seems to work although a few of the signs are hidden or bent in the wrong direction so some people had no idea what was going on  not but which helped me keep busy assisting people while waiting at the gates food and wine on notboard was quite good and overall service excellent including recognising my one world status ba has the best in notflight magazine with articles actually worth reading and also has some very clever in notflight programs i also particularly welcomed the excellent service from 'goswami' who found me a window seat for lhr nothkg when returning and when using the first lounge at heathrow all notin  notall made for an enjoyable experience a rarity these days
  faro to gatwick club check in was fairly quick and the priority security worked well at faro ba now do have use of a 3rd party lounge here which sadly is absolutely awful it feels like an average office canteen with no comfortable chairs and only just enough seats at all for every there its really very tiny and is the only lounge for all the airline as well as lounge schemes like priority pass etc considering this is the only lounge in a massive brand new airport its a pathetic offering food was minimal and british-airwayssic drinks were pretty limited and they british-airwaysrely ever had any glasses or plates available whilst ba do provide priority boarding they do not offer any form of priority to enter the gate and there is always a large queue for this once on board i have similar comments to my outbound flight in my opinion they should provide a better welcome a welcome drink and hand out menus prior to take off overall food and drink offering was pretty good on this flight although cabin crew could have been a bit friendlier at  point i dropped  of my headphs and it bounced several rows forward under some elses seat i was looking around for a while to find it and at no point did the crew offer to help at all instead just looking mildly annoyed that i was temporarily blocking the aisle in order to retrieve it priority disembritish-airwaysrkation and british-airwaysggage at gatwick worked well and it meant we missed all queues at immigration and we landslide really quickly
  gatwick to faro club check in at gatwick is very quick and easy and fastrack security is also very efficient and we were quickly through to the club lounge the lounge itself is really nice spacious enough to have plenty of seating available and different types of seating but it also feels very cosy and welcoming the lounge was clean and tidy and there were pretty good food options available including some lovely scs with clotted cream and jam as always the drinks offering in ba lounges was great the new boarding by group seems to be working quite well and ba staff are finally enforcing the priority system long may it continue on board was the usual club europe offering which while not exactly luxury is standard for europe now and for a 3 hour flight is fine ba dont ever seem to offer a welcome drink on short haul flights which was a shame as there is plenty of time after the initial boarding rush is complete there was also no personal welcome or greeting of any kind its a quick and simple gesture that should be d on any decent carrier i  also like to see menus handed out before take off which could be d at the same time as a welcome the food and drink offering on board is reasonable although food was typically over cooked and with sloppy presentation overall a decent enough flight and for a reasonable price but a few small touches  make it feel much better
  jeddah to chicago via london the flight from jeddah to heathrow was not as good as i expected ground staff at jeddah some of them were rude also the new british-airwaysggage restriction for the flights to the uk made the trip uncomfortable i had to check my carry noton british-airwaysg at the gate because my laptop charger and the power british-airwaysnk were there they took my laptop when i dropped my british-airwaysgs and they told me there is no need to take the chargers however the crew were nice and friendly and the food was delicious too the flight from lhr to chicago was full and the crew were helpful and generous  i wo not fly with ba again until they change their british-airwaysggage restrictions for the saudi flights
  london to frankfurt i need to fly ba for business frequently as i do not have other choices not only planes are delayed as today but the lounges in heathrow are a joke i do not use them anymore as they are overcrowded and they do not serve proper food just snacks their customer service is horrible and never helps me with any requests their business class in europe is economy class with a free seat next to you
 gatwick to malaga when booking the tickets i realised that by choosing certain flights in club the fare was cheaper than economy once i had added suitcases and pay for food onboard i hadn´t flown ba club in europe for a while and was looking forward to it i was nicely impressed my outbound flight was a wet notlease by titan but this was the full ba service the crew were very good as they were friendly and polite without being sugary sweet i was very impressed by the quality and quantity of the food toher with the selection of drinks the only fault is that on both legs my suitcase did not come out as priority despite being tagged correctly
  bermuda to gatwick usual window and aisle seat taken crew friendly enough but when all meal options had cheese including sandwiches not good when some cannot eat cheese breakfast usual offering ok but not really worth the my paid seats clean and comfortable just feel it is time for ba to offer seats so people do not need to pole vault over other passenger's legs to  out from the window seat in the night
  aberdeen to boston via london heathrow i found the seats were not wide enough and leg room was restricted on the way british-airwaysck to london the person in front of me put the seat british-airwaysck as well and this severely decreased and room i had to move also the narrower seats meant that i really had to avoid taking up both arm rests otherwise they were good flights with slightly odd choices but decent food extensive entertainment options/variety as well 
  london to hamburg baggage self notcheck notin was diabolical  machines were either slow or not working boarding commenced early resulting in on time departure seat for this short flight was quite comfortable and better than most european carriers however the total lack of any kind of refreshment was poor i do not expect a meal but even a drink of water  have been something crew were friendly and the flight on time
 flew london heathrow to hong kong with british-airways flew premium economy and the experience was anything but check yourself in create and scan your own british-airwaysggage labels and load them onto the conveyors yourself unsurprisingly slow process and waited over an hour for the struggling passengers ahead of us in line hardly a ba service attendant in sight better service with ryanair i hate to say it
 flew to istanbul with british-airways on 5th june at the passport/visa check desk presented printed boarding pass to the ba lady  not my wife was holding the passports the lady looked at the boarding passes and british-airwaysrked 'passports' as if she did not see my wife holding them second british-airwaysrk: 'do you have a visa' third british-airwaysrk: 'show me' fourth british-airwaysrk: 'next' no smile no 'hello' or 'good morning' hardly any eye contact either if anything the situation was worse at boarding ba recently introduced a boarding notby notgroup notnumber system all such systems need to be policed but there are ways of policing the arrangements some passengers attempted to board before their group number was call when caught by the gate keeper they were told 'not yet' some attempted to board prematurely more than once on the second attempt the staff told them to wait accepting that the system must be monitored ba gate staff should be better trained how to deal with potentially anxious passengers and reminded that not every speaks or understands english
  munich to london heathrow with british-airways i booked my flight online about 3 months ahead of my planned travel date and thought i  give this airline another try after a british-airwaysd experience earlier in the year i give full marks to ba on this occasion in most areas of service i arrived at the airport rather stressed as my mobile ph had been stolen in a salzburg coffee shop the check notin agent was very professional and reassuring towards me and entered into british-airwaysnter very willingly he was professional and pleasant and very efficient too the flight was on an a320 and boarding was managed well and the staff well presented too the cabin crew were welcoming and orderly although there was a delay it was managed well and the cabin crew explained matters as the flight progressed i bought an overpriced tea and felt very comfortable arrival was at a remote stand and then a bus overall a very good experience with ba
 wonderful service on the flight from edinburgh notflorence on 7 july 18 mainline british-airways could learn lots from ba cityflyer and their franchise partner in s africa com air
 london heathrow to manchester it was outrageous of british-airways to put me on a standby boarding pass when i checked in at lhr on the 05/07 i bought paid and the the booking was confirmed two months before the flight date how dare ba do this to me when i was travelling for 12 hours and everything ran like a clock work different airlines until i encountered ba at heathrow check notin and help desk are arrogant rude and are as miserable as hell not even a simple apology for the amount stress they caused me just here is a £5 voucher and wait till 40 minutes before departure to see if you have a seat we were 12 passengers who had the same treatment from ba british-airways is a disgrace of an airline because they have a monopoly on the heathrow slots they think they can  a way with such disgraceful service well they are wrong like others i have found an alternative airline i close my review and say i will never ever use british-airways again i  rather walk to manchester
  london to madrid lazy seat allocation has led to my husbritish-airwaysnd and i not sitting toher  i understand i can pay to  a seat i want but other than having a seat next to my husbritish-airwaysnd i dont want any particular seat we are travelling as a pair there are three seats each side of the aisle there will likely be single passengers travelling who have chosen a seat preventing us from sitting toher as they dont know what groups are travelling and do t care where they sit ba bothering to do the seat allocations for all the passengers you dont wish to pay for specific seats  avoid this 
  luggage broken into – no explanation first the good point cabin attendants were very diligent and friendly in business class on ba169 london to shanghai on 22 june not so good the bizarre seating pattern that allows 8 business class seats across the width of the plane feels cramped and crowded compared to a herringb arrangement the trust breaker upon arrival in shanghai i was not the only  from ba169 reporting missing luggage mine arrived 3 days later and the zip locking mechanism had been forced open and damaged beyond repair or further use nothing was missing so was it subject to search as unaccompanied luggage people deserve an answer when luggage arrives in that state ba have not provided any explanation despite queries to customer relations; this is not acceptable corporate behaviour like this not only lets down the customer but leaves an impression that betrays and outweighs the efforts made by their own cabin staff
  london to tehran british-airwaysck in august 2017 the cabin looked so old and tired i struggle to understand why ba has not updated yet on a lot of their b777 aircraft the inflight entertainment screen was small with a resolution of something from the 90s but the selection of movies was alright the meal service commenced 2 and a half hours after taking off and considering this was a night flight most of us were been starving at this point the option i wanted ran out by the time they got to me and i was not even sitting in the last rows of the economy section  the seats were very uncomfortable a couple hours later there was another drinks service 
  pisa to london heathrow having booked and paid for extra leg room seats six months in advance we were unpleasantly surprised to find out that upon checking our booking on the ba website a couple of weeks before flying there had been a change of aircraft our new seats were shown as exit row seats and we therefore assumed that they  be extra leg room but upon boarding we realised that row 22 of an a321 aircraft is standard seat pitch why did not ba notify us of a seat change when they knew of this change weeks in advance of our flight once we'd boarded we found that there was  extra leg room seat still available which was fortunate because my husbritish-airwaysnd is tall and needs that extra leg room the ba cabin crew did move my husbritish-airwaysnd but said this happens all the time with row 22 it might be an exit row but it's not extra leg room
  i recently took a first class flight from london heathrow to las vegas and due to a plane change a number of people where upgraded the plane was not ready for passengers and we boarded 35 minutes late when we boarded things were still not ready and the staff were rushing around the service on the outbound flight was fine but the plane was old and dated the return flight was a disaster the seats were dirty food was like rubber plane was dated seats smelt lauren perrier was not served on takeoff for some reason some new policy apparently and again we had upgraded people in first which is not great when i complained i was offered 8000 avios are you serious ba i think there are many other airlines out there with a first class product which is much better than that i experienced on british-airways unless a first class ticket on british-airways is on sale i  suggest you fly with another airline british-airways planes are dirty they have been told a number of times they are dirty  not its about time they  had a deep clean and re notmodel the first class its ting so old its like club class with a few tweaks
  had four flights in total with this airline first flight from dublin to london on 29th june 2018 was delayed by 2 hours this delay  have meant we missed our connection in heathrow to miami except that plane was also delayed by 2 hrs no reason or apologies we arrived in miami hours behind schedule which took away our only evening there as we were ting a cruise the following morning by the time we arrived we had missed our hotel transfer causing further expense as we had to hail a cab our flights home to dublin via heathrow were fine until we reached dublin and realised they had lost our british-airwaysg despite assurances it  be delivered to our house later that day it was put on the wrong plane  not again no apologies given for this inconvenience we are still awaiting the british-airwaysgs arrival and the ph numbers we were given keep ringing out seems like no  cares this was our first and last experience of using ba
  johannesburg to heathrow british-airways are not doing us proud i recently flew british-airwaysck from south africa with some sports equipment their web site states that you can take sports equipment as part of your luggage allowance but i was charged £65 to bring my bike british-airwaysck the check in staff were very forceful and abrupt as i had to bring the bike british-airwaysck i had no choice but to pay when i got british-airwaysck i contacted their customer service they are not willing to help  also the seats are ting really uncomfortable the food is terrible 
  the queue for british-airwaysg drop was massive and did not move for a good 20 mins a more senior person came and explained it was due to software issues that there was a delay in the british-airwaysg drop excuses as i saw more staff came afterwards and the queue was moving fine they could have just got more staff there to begin with group boarding was super slow inside the econ cabin the plane seemed very old and worn notout the entertainment system took a long time to reboot and they did not inform the customers about it some of the flight attendants were unprofessional meals were british-airwaysd for me the dinner was some sort of curry chicken that did not taste good they gave energy british-airwaysrs for breakfast meal on a 6h 50 mins flight the wifi does not exist in the cabin
  british-airways changed plane and consequently seating separating family in business class no co notordination at airport and apparently not  ba manager at rome airport who i could speak to had to call ba customer service in uk which was a waste of time given bulkhead seats but upon boarding could not take seat as engineers trying to secure cabin divider in changed position failed to do this and left the plane with it unsecured as pilot did not want to miss take off slow advised stewardess but they did not care could not recline seat for fear of cabin divider falling and curtain was in front of seat waste of time paying to go business class with ba  they did make us wear a seat belt upon take off so if the bulk head fell we could not  out of the way
  mumbritish-airwaysi to edinburgh via london i'm quite surprised to read the varied reviews as i have always had a great experience with ba in terms of in notflight service and airport handling after sales service can be a different experience this flight i arrived a little late at the airport due to transport issues hot and sweaty and the check notin girl was such a blessing she calmed me down reassured me and helped me  through security swiftly i was able to secure a very cheap last notminute upgrade to premium economy and i am so glad i did the service was wonderful we were looked after very well lots of water offered throughout the flight i thought the seat was tremendously spacious and comfortable even for the regular upgrade price 2 rather than 3 seats to the side and 3 rather than 4 in the centre gives you a lot more space the food was ok i've had worse i've had better but i was comfortable a good temperature and had a great choice of films my connecting plane was late leaving heathrow to edinburgh due to british-airwaysd weather but it was handled very nicely all in all i'm glad i flew ba for this trip
  mumbritish-airwaysi to london heathrow disappointing experience i  not book business class again felt like british-airwaysd value for my i've flown economy and premium economy before found economy british-airwayssic and the seat uncomfortable but enjoyed premium economy for the quieter cabin and more space i expected a big step up in business class but really apart from choice of food better seat and a larger entertainment screen i really did not see an upgrade in comparison to the huge extra cost the staff were not that attentive so i felt like i got  much better meal with alcohol and then was pretty much left al until an hour before the end of the flight i had  person ask if i needed anything who then brought me the tea i requested the staff were helpful when i saw them but overall what a waste of my i paid an extra £500+ for better food on a tray with cutlery really not worth it
  delhi to london having read many negative reviews about british-airways i boarded my flight fully expecting to have a british-airwaysd experience but ended up feeling completely satisfied with all aspects of the flight it is all too easy to glamourise the old days but in its seeming decline british-airways is no different to other european airlines as a resident of the netherlands i hear dutch people saying exactly the same about klm their national airline and french friends say the same about air france the onboard service was efficient and friendly if a little lacking in charm the food was more than adequate the in notflight entertainment was adequate too i'm not sure if the extra  pays for economy plus is really worth it in terms of better food but if space and the quietness that comes with a smaller cabin matters then it is worth it when we landed at heathrow a shortage of ground staff meant that we were stuck in the plane for 40 minutes before some could be found to operate the bridge to let us off those people with connecting flights were naturally beginning to panic but the crew handled the situation admirably they more than rose to the occasion to provide the information and reassurance that passenger were seeking
 when you travel british-airways its like you are lucky to be able to be with british-airways staff right from the start the check in girl on business told us the flight was closed which was a load of rubbish 1 hour and 10 minutes before the flight she spent ten minutes on the ph to some to see if it was too late because i need special assistance they did not have any to push my wheelchair so my wife had to do it my wife now very stressed and i arrive at the finger and when we could see that every was still there i asked the man on the desk about being closed and he said nonsense my wife says thanks for the unnecessary stress the guys on the desk were great and offered to push my chair which was actually quite a long way the cabin layout has 7 seats across whereas all the other 787's i have been on have 6 that means they are squeezing in another seat and it is very very narrow the cabin crew knocking my arm every time they passed by of course the 787 is a great aircraft so for me the seat was below my expectation i was also amazed that i had to pay £190 to reserve seats i do not pay anything with other airlines the food was just ok nothing exciting and the choice of films was not that great but then that is all personal choice in my opinion fly with a different airline if you can there are seriously better airlines who do not have snobs working for them
  british-airways s plenty of well deserved kickings but this return flight to gibraltar was faultless on time early arrival in fact smiling friendly crew excellent hot meal and plentiful drinks gatwick lounge is too small really but we found seats ok gibraltar lounge for the dozen or so club passengers is relatively huge
  ba first class is not even that any more starting with the lounge in t3; this may be an offshoot of the fine concorde room in t5 but it need not feel like a rural train station poor food average drinks and an indifferent staff do not compare with lh facilities in fra or muc there is no ground assistance and boarding was haphazard fine cornish champagne was offered and happily quaffed the seat was ok but not in the same class as the new ac j class pods and not close to the emirate's suites small things like the menu presentation boarding sufficient food there are a lot of seats in f seat comfort ok but nothing special and the toilets small and curiously offering single notply paper the crew were very friendly; the service was decent in delivery but poor overall ba your relentless drive to the bottom is catching up with you and your first class product is not worth the name anymore one can only assume that ba are trying to phase it out as they drive any paying passengers to other airlines who place a serious effort to deliver a superb premium product and no wi notfi
  linate to london the morning of the departure i received an email and a text message from that warned me that my flight had been canceled with no specified reason as an alternative they rerouted me on a night flight to madrid then to palma to arrive the next day in birmingham disappointed of the disservice i called the customer service in england and waited 40 minutes at my expense before being able to speak with an operator and i was offered a flight in the evening at 1900 which did not help me to arrive in time to my appointment and therefore declined i had to find the only possible flight that  allow me to  to london in time unfortunately it was a last minute flight with another company that cost me a fortune on top of it since the flight  arrive no longer at heathrow but at stansted i had to pay the taxi £70 more than the agreed amount if i arrived at heathrow british-airways did not take responsibility i was not reimbursed the new flight i had to book last minute nor the taxi difference they did not show concern for the inconvenience and the stress caused the worst has been the answer of their customer care saying it was not their responsibility
 flew british-airways from jk to london heathrow then connected london galwick to rome bag has been lost for 48 hours no email ph call text update they didnt even answer my email my wife and i have had the same clothes on our british-airwayscks since we left jfk thank goodness for washing machines we have missed out on events we cant  into certain places due to dress codes we had to wait for a store to open to buy toothbrushes and toothpaste horrible horrible service then we were told our british-airwaysg  arrive at our hotel at 430 pm yesterday its almost 1 pm the next day and the british-airwaysg still isnt here 
 i have flown british-airways numerous times over many years sadly the experience has deteriorated significantly recently and this flight was particularly poor the staff were offhand and  seemed particularly unhappy to be there the person next to me and i asked for the beef choice but were told that there was n left  not too little had apparently been loaded there was no apology and we were simply told we needed to make another choice we asked for the fish after some delay we were given our meals but found we had both been given a vearian meal i had to walk down to the galley to let them know and was told in a very offhand manner that they must have recorded the wrong choice  not no apology eventually we received the fish which by then was dry and not enjoyable we were asked for breakfast choices and gave in cards which stated we wanted a light choice 40 minutes before landing we were not given anything the service was really poor  not and as usual the business seats were falling behind the quality and comfort found in other airlines ba will really have to improve their product to continue to attract premium passengers
 we can not fault the new 'club world' food and service on the 747 outbound and 777 inbound it was great the food was first class the presentation very attractive the quality very high  not have not had such tender beef on any airline before or in a restaurant for that matter lately and the new style crockery/glass wear stylishly upmarket it's worlds away from what it used to be both crews were attentive friendly and cheerful really liked the way the food came out on a trolley and you could pick and choose what you liked and mix and match if you wanted to you now  a light day blanket a padded blanket for night and a mattress protector type thing to put on the british-airwaysse of your seat much better than the thin always static blanket you used to  the pillow is larger and tons better than before ca not believe how fast the time flew and how well we felt on landing both in seattle and once home again we do mainly club europe flights shame as if this level of service and food is maintained the new club world will be a great success
  very disappointing experience  not flew out on a 747 400 series should be scrapped departed late loaded aircraft ready for push british-airwaysck no a/c temperature was excessively hot all flight no cool air personal media system broken split screen food quality diabolical moody flight attendants ran out of hand soap return flight on a380 left on time 100% better service meal quality and crew definitely made up for outward flight been flying ba for over 25 years probritish-airwaysbly  be a last choice in future  not sad to see
  calgary to london cabin full overhead locker full of blankets seat excruciatingly uncomfortable and headph that worked intermittently take off about 1945 local time evening meal appeared at about 2030 local time menu listed seasonal salad leaf  small piece of lettuce and cucumber braised short rib of beef or mushroom ravioli pasta with butter pecan cake only 3 beef meals available choice was either pasta or to go hungry i chose the latter and dined on a small bottle of water and half a cup of tomato juice breakfast a light refreshment including juice tea and coffee consisted of a cream cheese roll and oat biscuit and half a cup of warm tea some 30 minutes later we paid extra for world traveller plus but i consider that we were conned customer services have been useless and on the second time of writing i received the following response thanks for coming british-airwaysck to us i completely understand why youre disappointed we couldnt offer you our full catering service especially as on such a long haul flight i hope our staff explained our catering supplier had an unexpected problem with the systems they use to deliver their catering this meant they couldnt provide a full meal service and i absolutely agree this isnt what you  expect when you travel with us im sorry weve let you down that is it thank you ba this is the last time we will ever book long haul with you
  london to zurich the airline isnt british-airwaysd their boarding procedure was very good though the aircraft was very old i know it is  of the oldest and personally i enjoyed it but if i have to be realistic its very old loud and uncomfortable the service isnt good either you dont even  a cup of water its great to hop to london but dont expect any kind of special treatment or service
  glasgow to new york jfk via london outgoing flight was on a refurbished 747 still i could see its age we had a duo seat at the british-airwaysck of the plane the plane was hot and there are no air con vents above your head the ife was decent and had a good selection the cabin crew member looking after us was pleasant and friendly and he chatted to us flight left close to on time service was quick as we were first served at the british-airwaysck we were given pretzels and drinks first then dinner was about an hour later which was vearian pasta for me adequate amount of food served and was tasty ice cream and juice/water was served halfway through the flight we then received a snack before landing which was a sandwich and a tobler it was ok return flight from vegas was on a old 747 horrible old seats with no padding and very dirty service was a lot slower as they announced they had less staff less drinks served again food was ok chicken curry this time small snack of a egg tortilla yoghurt and muffin served for breakfast ife was horrendous on the old 747 tiny grainy screen with a very limited choice i nt fly ba again if i had a choice because they charge such a large amount for choosing the duo seats £210 return it cost us and it made the air fare expensive also the planes they use are too old and tatty
  flew on a last minute emergency trip london heathrow to baltimore with ba most disappointing feature on this roundtrip was the aircraft the new boeing 787 i found the aircraft too small and cramped for transatlantic routes in its 3 not3 not3 seating configuration despite the crews in flight service and the inflight entertainment being of a generally average economy standard the aircraft lacked the legroom and seating comfort of the other aircraft i have flown on other transatlantic routes 777 767 a340 and 747 ba needs to remove many seats from this aircraft in economy class also the cabin air temperature was awful and humid with no individual regulation this felt to me more like being crammed in to a boeing 737 on a transatlantic flight
  earlier this year my wife and i travelled business class with ba from dublin to jo'burg returning from cape town thru london in each direction having paid business class fares we were then quite taken abritish-airwaysck to have to pay an additional €476 for seat selection on the long haul sectors had we not selected seats we could have found ourselves not just separated but possibly with  of us on the upper deck and  on the lower deck of the a380 on the way out and the 747 on the return flight we therefore had no choice what sort of customer retention policy is this no other airline with whom we have travelled business class has then charged for seat selection but ba just do not seem to care it is a rip notoff the forward/rear facing business class seat plan on ba planes is really unattractive complicated further by having to climb over a sleeping passenger to reach the aisle from a window seat ba should take a look at the emirates a380 if they want to see a customer friendly layout this was our first business class experience with ba having flown with middle eastern airlines particularly we have discovered how much behind the play ba actually are
  los angeles to london i booked with aa lax to lhr round trip very far in advance ba is aa partner paid for the ba seat selection early to  good seats ba canceled the flights coming and going ba did not inform aa or me that the flights were canceled all of my text and ph number was entered with ba with my passport number they should have contacted me i found out a couple days before my flight because i happened to call to do a meal request it turns out that ba shifted to smaller planes and i actually spent six hours over two days trying to  flights on the days i needed to catch up with a tour all they said is we ca not help you i kept calling and calling and got seats on the days i needed but they were the worst seats on the plane and because they were smaller planed premium economy was awful food was terrible we had pre paid $276 to choose seats there were no good seats left we ended up on a night flight right next to the toilets which meant the smell people are bumping into you the lights going off and toilets flushing for 9 hours same seats coming home i  have been better off flying in coach i have spent a month trying to  refund for the paid seat selection i tried to  this before my return flight started because i was still calling and calling to  seats away from the toilets on our return flight and to  our refundsthey  not refund after returning i made five ph calls and spent 30 mins filling out a detailed request online called again today was disconnected twice and told there is nothing i could do it is possible i may  a response in a month regarding my email request do not ever fly with them they used to be the finest airline in the skies but now their system is broken and there is no such thing as customer service if you have a problem you will be up a famous creek without a paddle they have an endless loop of calling waiting on line their agent's ca not or wo not do anything but sell seats i spoke to many many supervisors no results there is no  to solve problems they pass the buck have you fill out forms online and no  responds
  the overall flight was not too british-airwaysd seats and everything was comfy enough although my girlfriends television did not work for either the outbound or inbound flight and little effort was made for a resolution i understand that it is not the flight attendants fault  but it  have been nice if a little more effort than 'there's nothing we can do' was given to the issue on the flight from gatwick to tampa we were stuck on the aircaft for approximately 30 not40 minutes as the bridge 'was not where it should be' which once again was not the worst problem in the world but after a long flight is not particularly what you wanted it was not the best experience 
" 
bas galleries lounge at cpt is adequate but let down by a poor food selection including packaged cheese and biscuits with flimsy wooden knives and limited wine choices champagne was conspicuously lacking toilet paper wasnt being refreshed in the toilets and here was no lock on  of the cubicle doors there were no information screens so  had to wait for the tannoy call to board boarding itself was efficient with priority for groups 1 and 2 seats 62j/k on the upper deck are the best of a mediocre job and at least there's plenty of storage space in the window bins take off was on schedule fas went through the motions with little enthusiasm the food was the worst we've ever experienced in club world the 'smoked chicken salad' was atrocious and the 'scrambled eggs with chives in a tortilla wrap' deserves to be in a museum of culinary horrors the white company bedding was a let notdown and far removed from the luxury portrayed in adverts there's little  can do to remedy a hard seat landing was ahead of schedule overall a lacklustre flight in an ancient plane with a sub notpar business class product british-airways are falling ever behind their competitors"
  gatwick to san jose ive just stepped onto a ba flight from gatwick to costa rica an 115 hr flight and can hstly i havent seen a screen with so few pixels since the 90s i  fly other long haul flights and n of bas competitors are providing such low quality entertainment  i used to think of british-airways as being a premium airline  not now theyre just rubbish
 i took the new option of the new toronto to london gatwick which debuted this summer as a seasonal route cheaper than the heathrow service it was an interesting experiment in whether i could fall british-airwaysck in love with gatwick excellent check in at pearson as usual but spoiled by the third party lounge goodness knows what ba were thinking given the old lounge was well run with excellent drinks and food options the premium plaza lounge is cheap and nasty on time boarding on a near empty flight too early in the season for the return traffic to have built up the cabin was a third full juice and water offered no prosecco in premium economy though the crew member could not explain why it's not offered to london but why champagne in biz is manageable on time departure and a fast drinks service this is my first experience of gatwick crew fast sociable less formal and streets ahead of mixed fleet crew serving heathrow and all over 25 the meal was vile  not overcooked salty and dry as the plane was empty i went british-airwaysck to economy and had three hours sleep across three seats awful breakfast of pretzel roll and cream cheese was served before landing ife on both legs was dated and still the same selection since my flights at christmas an early arrival and fast british-airwaysgs finished off a ok flight returning i liked the biz / first class check in area at lgw  not fast and friendly the lounge at gatwick was streets ahead of heathrow self serve champagne and loads of seats kept very clean and plenty of food an upgrade to biz was nice on a full flight efficient boarding and a fast coat / drink and menu service a really fast british-airwaysr service only 20 mins in with well cooked food made the service just like the old days of long haul cabin crew from heathrow the only thing that spoilt it was off duty ba staff in biz chatting and distracting the crew on duty while drinking in the aisle and generally being loud and annoying an early arrival into toronto finished a near perfect flight the gatwick 777s are old  not very old with no power in premium economy currently going through a refurb progamme but with efficient and friendly crew and on time / early performance  not there was little to dislike and i even liked gatwick
  first time flying with british-airways in economy on a transatlantic flight from london to chicago i was impressed by the hard work of the professional and friendly flight attendants they walked up and down the plane helping people with various issues and offering good tasty meals snacks and drinks of all kinds i will definitely fly british overseas again given a chance the economy seats on this old but well kept boeing 747 not400 were very comfortable and i am a 5'9 x 240lbs and still did not feel cramped i  encourage all my friends to fly british if they want to have a very comfortable flight from the us to europe thank you british-airways very good service indeed
  geneva to vancouver via london worst experience terrible service and when we wrote with constructive criticism they offered £25 voucher and no apology  not an insult as did not ask for compensation it's an expensive price to pay for a low cost airline on a positive point the geneva to london flights were fine but the 2 long haul flights to vancouver were abysmal
  this is the first time i have flown ba's club europe flying from london heathrow to corfu i was not expecting a great deal having read a lot of less than positive reviews online however i was very pleasantly surprised shortly after boarding we were offered a welcome drink with a british-airwaysg of nuts and a choice of magazine to read not long after this there was a full drinks service followed but a 4 course meal which was very tasty i had cured salon followed by chicken breast then ginger cheesecake and a small cheese plate we were then offered a choice of hot drinks and a top up of champagne the crew were very attentive and helpful they had a smile on their face all the time and the flight seemed to zip past the seats were the usual economy seats with the middle blanked by a tray but for a relatively short trip it was fine this flight was an upgrade using avios and i  happily do it again i paid around 6500 avios and an extra £13 in taxes which i think was very good value for what i had
  our original flight was cancelled as my wife and i were just disembritish-airwaysrking from a cruise ship we were then advised shortly after by sms that we had been automatically re notbooked on a flight the next day to london heathrow this was not a lot of good when our car was parked at gatwick i managed to  through to ba and was given a new booking to gatwick also the following day we were offered no other assistance by the airline the following day we turned up at the airport to find the new flight was running 40 minutes late having eventually boarded the aircraft we stayed at the gate for about 45 minutes before the captain deigned to tell us that the delay was being caused by problems at barcelona airport shortly thereafter the captain advised us that we might wait for another two hours so we  be given water this was quickly superseded by a further announcement that a slot had become available at short notice so no water was served the real horror of this flight however was british-airways new food service whereby passengers buy food and pay by card/avios this simply does not work after  hour in the air the trolley had moved about nine rows from the front of the cabin eventually a flight attendant attempted to work from the british-airwaysck forward by running british-airwaysckwards and forwards from the trolley about 20 minutes from touchdown he reached us and we asked for two cans of drink and a packet of crisps potato chips he returned to tell us he had no crisps and only  can which we duly shared between us having been on the aircraft for three and a half hours this was the only refreshment we could obtain i consider this to be completely unacceptable if this is the level of service we can now expect from british-airways there is no point traveling with them the bud airlines can do better at lower cost
  hong kong to london this was my first business class trip on ba as i mostly use emirates or cathay pacific in comparison ba offers a very low standard the flight attendant who served the section where i was seated could not have cared less no greetings when passengers boarded the plane no offer of help he asked for my drink order but never delivered the drink no second drink was offered the toilet had not been cleaned properly before boarding and during the flight  of the two washrooms became unusable resulting in long queues the seating arrangement  not having to face a stranger who sits in the opposite direction not is uncomfortable overall appalling quality and little value for my
  washington to bucharest return via london i was originally booked in world traveller plus but at dulles check notin was offered a club world upgrade at just $499 more which i accepted  not resulting flight was very comfortable with good food and top notdrawer service the two london notbucharest sectors both went well but all this was just a prelude to my return trip while in bucharest i sustained a fall and although i was not seriously hurt it was still difficult to walk long distances especially with heavy luggage at the bucharest airport british-airwaysg drop the agent noticed my situation and offered assistance which i accepted  not and was promptly wheeled through security passport control and the very long corridors to the gate then put aboard the plane on arrival in london i was met by more assistance to whisk me through the vastness of t5 and onto the plane this time with the pleasant surprise of another club world upgrade this time for free once on the plane british-airwaysck to washington the cabin crew could not do enough for me checking how i was doing going through meal choices the menu this time round was a bit heavy on cheese and other dairy items i really ca not eat but ultimately i still ate well ting me drinks and more they were as professional and proactive a crew as i've ever experienced in 40 years of long nothaul travel finally once arrived at dulles more assistance was waiting right up to ting my cab what could have been an ordeal on this return trip was turned into as relaxing and satisfying a travel experience as can be imagined  not through the years i've had mostly excellent experiences with ba cabin crews and that's a big reason why i've stayed with ba all these years and will continue to do so but a big standing ovation for the cabin and ground crews for these flights for above notand notbeyond service  not you're the best
  london to warsaw ba european service is becoming like an expensive low cost airline the price of seat selection still remains high the seat on the outbound flight is not even reclining and it was a 2 nothour flight  you can always feel the elbows of the passengers next to you whenever some is moving i did not buy any food or drink onboard although i reckon it's not british-airwaysdly priced the inbound flight was on an older a320 in which the seat was reclining 
  london to istanbul due to poor weather conditions at lhr the flight was initially delayed by 2 hours which is quite understandable when the passengers were informed of the gate every gathered at the 'a' gate in t5 then no announcement and the ground staff were in a world of their own next there is a screen notice that the flight will depart from a c gate every rushes to the  of the last of the 'c' gates once on board the dreaded announcement that the flight will be delayed by another hour the flight finally takes off nearly three hours late after a while the crew comes with the m&s gibberish but passengers are so hungry that by the time the crew serve the fifth row in economy the sandwiches are all over and i had packet of crisps and a diet coke for dinner the flight arrived in istanbul three hours late and to add insult to injury the aircraft stops at a remote gate and we have to trek to the terminal 
  london to cape town flying first class with british-airways is a hit notor notmiss affair but having secured a couple of return flights to cape town with avios our expectations were running high as we entrusted our car to the meet and greet parking unfortunately terminal 3 is not the best starting point and galleries first lacks glamour  not or decent champagnes the food on offer is adequate although hardly first class hoping for better on board we did not use the sit down menu boarding was on time and according to ba's new group allocation our seats  not 2k and 3k  not were a first for us as we've previously g for pairs in the centre but seats a and k are definitely superior with more storage space and better privacy however there's no escaping the fact that the relatively recent first class refit is in a relatively ancient plane particularly when  inspects the shabby state of fittings in the toilets and galley the ife is also showing its age and british-airwaysdly in need of an upgrade but at least it did not require rebooting on our flight cabin crew in first were the usual mixed british-airwaysg the fa looking after our side seemed to be in the wrong job food was better than usual although a malfunctioning oven meant that we had to wait 30 minutes for our hot breakfast landing was ahead of schedule and we were through immigration and british-airwaysggage reclaim within 15 minutes overall a decent flight but let down by the attitude of the cabin crew and the age of the plane
  london to hamburg typically if i fly ba it is sfo or lax to lhr this time i flew them from miami via tampa thru lhr to hamburg using their avios points i secured a first class seat which of course is a scam because ba charges you fees and surcharges to use those points at $500 per direction their miami operation appears to be a poor second class cousin to american as they use two of their ticketing and check in kiosks plus share the american premium class not lounge all the american processed slices of cheese and bologna you can eat with free booze is not what i call a premium lounge the ba gate in the dreadful e terminal is not even on the main floor but downstairs people jammed up to the entry points for boarding which creates a mess of boarding people by sections boarding was like a cattle call ba flies  of its oldest b747 into miami and it showed even in first the seats were of the older design and it appeared the carpet was recent but the cabin smelled of moldy carpet the service and food was surprisingly good compared to their service out of california the flight was late leaving and late arriving and this miami flight does not dock in terminal 5 rather terminal 3 and requiring its passengers to take shuttle buses to the other terminals which is what i did for my connection to hamburg in the end i decided i was d with ba because their service model for premium passengers has  hit rock bottom their avios program is nearly worthless on any premium class booking or on its partner airlines try using ba points on american or cathay or even alaska and you will find it impossible regardless how far in advance you try 
 turin to london gatwick rubbish check notin service as british-airwaysd as ryanair i show the staff my mobile boarding pass checked website that i have 2 x 32 kg british-airwaysgs checked allowance one british-airwaysg was over 23 kg 27/28 they refused to honour the 32 kg allowance and told me i will risk myself to miss the flight and not able to check in they were so rude and unhelpful boarding was with the same unhelpful and unprofessional staff with the very arrogant manner flight was delayed without the checked notin agent saying anything after all passengers board they start to tell people there will be an hour or so delay due to weather at the very least the young crew serve passenger complimentary juice or water during the wait
  when i checked in the evening before for the 7am flight it looked like only 40% of seats were occupied 2 hrs before flight they cancelled it without rebooking or explanation there is not a hotline to call
  bas reputation has been declining for years so i dont use them for various reasons i had to for a flight for madrid i had hand luggage they texted asking for the hand luggage to be checked in as the flight was busy i did and they lost it 7 hours later no luggage or idea where it is no compensation  not only after 12 hours and for a small amount ridiculous airline which has managed to lose its prestige and good will lagging significantly behind easyjet in all aspects
  los angeles to london heathrow desperately poor service from british-airways in club class business class is utterly outdated with the weird facing each notother configuration and narrow / uncomfortable seats the food served was appalling the cabin crew were inattentive at best and appeared disinterested in providing genuine customer service the problem with british-airways now in first and business class is what they are completely lacking: namely any class or manners whatsoever poor food uncomfortable seats terrible / small movie screens no wifi and an overall bud airline experience british-airways even charge for seat selection too which adds insult to injury avoid this horrible airline if you can the only redeeming feature of this  airline is the wonderful quiet airbus a380 a shame ba ruin the aircraft with such a poor quality product and attitude
  london heathrow to mahon booked 9 months ago flights for first family holiday for 2 years for 2 adults 2 children and 1 infant in lap almost £1k for all of us pre notbooked seats at the same time i was rather surprised when i got an email two weeks out saying “about your flight to madrid on the 26th may” when i was flying direct heathrow to menorca airline assured me everything was fine further concern when self notservice check notin opened 24 hours out wife and daughters checked in fine me and my son were referred to airport check notin despite all being on the same booking an urgent call to ba i was told 1 i was probritish-airwaysbly being moved to a british-airwaysssinet position when i pointed out this was utter nonsense she reneged and said 2 infants cant check in online which i now understand is also incorrect my concern was well placed at ba t5 british-airwaysg drop check in agent looked flustered a note in the booking prompted her to call various people and after about ten minutes she handed me a bunch of boarding passes only after i checked them she sheepishly admitted that our pre notbooked seats were g my son and i had no seats at all and were standby and my wife and daughters were dotted all around the cabin 16 rows apart ‘prebooked seating is not guaranteed you know after kicking up a huge fuss i believe they cant legally sit children below a certain age away from parents the check notin manager offered me no explanation other than full flights but promised me it  be sorted once they got round to closing my flight fast forward to the gate – utter carnage including the check notin supervisor who cant have been more than 22 in tears when i eventually got seen i was finally given a seat number for me and my son again many rows apart from the rest of my family as this was my sons first ever flight i was absolutely livid that we couldnt sit anywhere near each other added to that my son is breastfed so how we are going to manage feeding kids needing toilet etc i put my foot down and was eventually given a single middle seat two rows again from my daughters who were by now sat toher thank goodness we boarded the flight pretty much last after all the furore & holding my son i  to my assigned seat and some is in it asking to see his boarding pass surprise surprise he is in the correct seat cue ba staff running around and frantically checking boarding passes such is the confidence that the cabin crew have in their own ground staff i even heard  of them mutter ‘check boarding cards and flight numbers as some around here is on the wrong flight fast forward another 5 mins and the plane is now pushing british-airwaysck with me standing in an aisle holding my son with not an empty seat on the plane with me saying to my wife that were going to have to  off here and my children in tears much checking of ipads and a ba staff member is then found there were quite a few on the flight apparently and hurriedly moved to the jumpseat whilst an announcement from the flight deck is booming out for every to take their seats or delay the flight what seat raised a formal complaint and was told that they 'understand my frustration' which is nice separate complaint raised to caa about a pushing british-airwaysck with passengers including an infant with no seat conclusion is families avoid at all costs
  dubritish-airwaysi to london heathrow lovely flight and a great ba worldwide crew which are the best in the ba fleet very good seat with great extras that you  expect in 1st class chose to sleep as it was a night flight but had a delicious full breakfast in the morning baggage allowance was superb with 3 x 32kg cases and 2 cabin british-airwaysgs overall a lovely flight with a great airline that has a great crew
  london heathrow to singapore on 28 may 2018 in this review i am reviewing the a la carte dining option on board for world traveller world traveller passengers have the option to pre notorder from a selection of 6 main courses up to 30 days in advance for selected long haul flights out of lhr with prices ranging from £15 to £18 i had the gourmet dining consisting of braised hertfordshire beef cheek which was succulent and delicious if you do not want to risk not ting your meal of choice on a long haul ba flight and if this a la carte option is available on your route i highly recommend you to go for it
  paris to newark flight cancelled this experience was  of the worst ive had the engineers had no idea what was wrong with the engine all air and water shut off for three hours not to mention the boeing 757 looked ancient for a 6 hour flight from paris i expected a little more the flight attendants did not keep us updated lastly after we got off the plane they had   receptionist at the desk to deal with the 60+ people who needed to rebook flights and  hotels for the night will never fly british airways again delta forever
  i flew ba from heraklion to gatwick i bought exit row seats for me and 3 others to sit toher with extra leg room i paid around £150 for that in january we got to the airport 2 hours before departure queued to check in and was told that 2 of the seats were reallocated to some else i asked why the ba rep said it was because the plane for the flight had changed she then said we should have got there earlier she  not call ba customer service when i showed her the email acknowledging 2 of us were given row 7 bulkhead seats with less room than normal pitch i was told to email ba and ask them to refund me the seat cost the flight manager on the plane told me there was no change of plane she apologised and said she'd take our case up with ba customer service i also sent in a complaint today is 17 days with no response and my my still not refunded i'll never fly with them again 
  outbound from lhr to washington on a refurbished 747 400 was in economy all in all was not a british-airwaysd experience modern looking cabin with excellent ife system food and wine was good and cabin crew very attentive was looking forward to the return trip as had upgraded to premium economy return flight ba 292 was delayed by late arrival of inbound flight but no worries could relax in the pe cabin boarding the aircraft and turning left for the first time ever immediate disappointed how old was the plane the cabin was dull and those seats looked as though they had seen better days a quick check and this particular 747 was delivered to 1998 and had not had the refurbishment treatment leg room was a tad better than economy but seat controls not very efficient and as for the ife system that decided not to work mind you the screen was so small and scratched i doubt i  have been able to watch anything cabin crew offered a pre take off drink water or orange juice and a hot towel that had seen better days it was the sort of thing that you clean your car with after a few words from the captain we departed the evening meal was some sort of chicken with rice with real cutlery and was ok wine and g&t was acceptable about 1 hour before landing breakfast was served or should i say offered some sort of filled roll i declined and had a tea in a paper cup and nothing more offered i should add that the cabin crew were very attentive and tried to make us feel a bit special for having spent an extra £400 for the upgrade ba this experience was a disgrace for a once proud airline never again
 singapore to london this was the second part of my sydney to london trip and looked forward to it as it was on a ba a380 now this aircraft in qantas colours is  i am very familiar with having flown around 30 sectors over the last 12 months with qf as mentid in my review of ba16 which was the first leg of this trip it is the on board soft product that is the problem the same comments for that review apply here the ife is a work of mystery in terms of content on qantas american cathay  s a really good mix of old and new movies great music choices those who compile the content need to look at what they mean by award winning godfather gladiator brave notheart roman holiday etc are all things we as passengers want to see some smart edgy team in soho london pulled the content toher forting that not every is edgy and want to see cutting edge stuff ife is  thing on long haul the other is food and beverage the food quality was just substandard and something i read about constantly on qantas say qf1 from singapore to london  s the evening meal service followed by weiss ice cream a lindt chocolate along the way midnight snack of a pizza or sandwich and morning breakfast fruit or eggs with usual muffin etc at the rear of the main deck is a snack british-airwaysr and in the galley will be found chocolates british-airwaysnana bread cheese and biscuits you  need to be really hungry to  through that lot but the point is that it is available and offered ba need to  away from a meal service on take off and landing and nothing in between the a380 is a flagship aircraft and on qantas it is treated as such i am a qantas fanboy and spend a lot of time on their planes put the smartest best looking crew onto a flagship as that is what people will remember the ba crew were of a certain vintage more suited to lawn bowls one guy looked like steptoe for those who remember and was a miserable flying on an a380 should be an experience and i enjoy all my trips on that aircraft ba have managed to reduce it to a very large low cost aircraft moving people from  point to another that is sad given the stature of ba i came british-airwaysck on ba31 from london to hong kong and the same comments apply hard product is fine except for no snack british-airwaysr but the soft product is lacking severely
 sydney to london via singapore it has been a very long time since i was on a long haul with ba of more than 9 hours last year had a relative sprint from london to jfk and before that in 2002 the years have not been kind to ba probritish-airwaysbly a mixture of the decline of ba and the emergence of other airlines nearly all my long haul is with qantas on its a380 occasionally emirates on its version and then once in a while with cathay pacific and american airlines the problem is not the hard product a b777 or the a380 in whatever colour and decor is ordered is the same air frame the b777 from sydney to singapore was fine nosier than the a380 but that is well known very comfortable seats and at 8 hours a relative sprint for those who call sydney home it is the soft product that is lacking check in was fine and despite being in economy had an express pass through security being a gold ff with qantas boarding was orderly and an on time departure and arrival into singapore now its just a lack of polish with the soft product no menu given showing what was to be served as with cathay emirates and qantas the cutlery was really cheap and i mean cheap kfc offers a better grade of plastic i know in these days of security that proper silverware is not possible but some at ba needs to check out the plastic used on cathay and qantas the food itself was very bland; a salad that had seen better days and penne with some sauce that was over salty qantas have d away with salads and simply give you a main dish plus garlic bread and a dessert it's just the quality that is lacking drinks i have a tradition something silly about starting a journey off with a jack daniels and coke this is available on qantas but no sir we do not serve that a note about the fa's: they were great but  s the feeling that they are chirpy to mask some of the shortcomings with the product they are asked to deliver final word about this leg is the ife a touchscreen but it was slow in response time and the selection was diabolically british-airwaysd award winning or classic films with not a noted film from the last 30 years one or two interesting things and some new releases come on ba for may being on a plane for that length of time is a perfect opportunity to catch up on much loved classics as for music: well i'm 53 but still like the pearl jams etc of the world we are not all into brit pop and edgy music presenters if ba is serious about the airline business then it needs to sharpen up the soft skills the food and beverage and add a touch of pizzazz about the airline it is a mix of ba going british-airwaysck and many others coming up and beyond the standards that ba set many years ago
  malaga to gatwick operated by titan airways very full business class of 36 people a sick flight attendant so just  female attendant handled al i wish to highly commend here despite al she managed perfectly 
  flew barcelona to gatwick this review is about the arrangement for check in rather than actual flight ba allows you to check in online but not to print out a boarding card there was no machine to print a card queue taking 75 minutes to  boarding card and several people were too late for check in there were 4 desks 2 for priority 2 for general check in for all flights only 1 desk served once they were about to close check in
  munich to london notheathrow with british-airways while british-airways is more or less in the same price range as lufthansa no complimentary food or drinks were served crew was friendly the departure was from terminal 1 in munich which is by far not as nice as the newer terminal 2 and arrival at terminal 5 in heathrow which is not as nice/easy as the new star alliance queens terminal 2 no wifi personal device entertainment or onboard monitors on my flight seat reservation too expensive in my eyes british airways has  big advantage though: the generous hand luggage rules
  this was an early morning flight from heathrow to keflavik the flight was not very full shortly after take off the cabin crew came around to sell m&s snacks and drinks reasonably priced this was a typical intra noteuropean flight on british-airways where food and drinks are for sale cabin crew were efficient i had the exit row seat so leg room was more than adequate
  cape town to london dated aircraft very poor cabin service semi inedible food and the inevitable entertainment system crash made for a very poor journey the cabin crew clearly regarded us as an intrusion and i do not feel that i should be having to ask for a drink with my main meal surely we should have been offered something as a matter of course i used to be happy to pay more to fly ba now i pay extra not to
  washington to prague via london i have flown them several times in the past but not for a number of years i remember them as not a top of the line airline but better than average this time it seemed that any nice things have been dropped hot towels as you neared your destination and they have become almost a low fare airline you pay for reserving seats on shorter flights you pay for food etc the seating on the boeing 787 seemed very cramped it is said to be 31 but seemed like less on the return flight on may 3rd two of the lavatories went out of service the a320 from london to prague seemed to have more seat room but the seats were very hard they may be the new slimline seats i'm not sure but they were very uncomfortable even for a two hour flight also on the washington  to lhr flight we had printed out boarding passes at home the agent at washington printed out additional s and said we should use them but when we got to security she had printed out two for me and n for my wife it was lucky we still had the  we printed out at home i wo not say that i will not fly them again but i will definitely compare prices in the future they are not worth any extra cost
  london to washington apart from the space nothing nothing was first class not even the comfort crew was hardly more attentive to service than in coach food which used to be fantastic is just eatable no more wines which were the best in the sky when jancis robinson and hugh johnson made the selection apart from a good white champagne but mediocre rosé are at the level of a business class and my seat did not have sound from the audio/video system: so they moved me and an hour later the whole system stopped without the crew apologizing needless to say no wifi apart from their lhr first and concorde room lounges at lhr which remain great ba is now no better than a 3 star airline sad for the clients and shameful for ba management
  i had called the british-airways customer service staff to ask about my plane change at london heathrow from washington dulles to glasgow i was told that clearing border control  be d at final destination at glasgow but this was not true passengers arriving into london heathrow from international and connecting to domestic flights have to clear uk border control long lines and then security screen again  before gaining access to flights even with mobility assistance and a fast track card and 80 minutes between flights it was a close call to make connections
  london to montreal i did my online check notin the night before and left to go to the airport i arrived at the airport 25 hours in advance went to a kiosk to print my boarding pass and the kiosk was not working so i proceeded to the ba counter to  my pass and check in my luggage i was in line for approximately 15 minutes when we were all told to switch lines the line we were moved to was substantially longer however i was patient by the time i got to the desk an hour had passed and i had a bit over an hour left to my flight i figured this was tight but all the while manageable since i trusted ba's system the woman at the counter asked me where i was going and when i said montreal she looked at me and said you wo not make it i explained the situation how i had been in the airport for several hours already and that i was in line for 1 hour she just told me i needed to go to the missed flight counter i got to the counter and they informed me that i had to buy a new return ticket my original return ticket cost me $800 my return cost me $1350  i had no choice but to buy the ticket i also had to stay in a hotel and then take a bus to gatwick airport the following morning once i arrived british-airwaysck in montreal i called ba customer services and they told me that it was protocol to put me on standby and not make me purchase a new ticket and that i could  a refund if not for the new flight then for the $400 of the flight i missed imagine my shock after spending an additional $1500 cad all in when i escalated my complaint they did not address my case for over a month and once they did they just said we cannot refund you and that was that 
  tokyo to amsterdam via london on the evening before departure i received an email from ba the flight  be delayed for  hour but we were urged to  to the airport on the original time in case there  not be a delay in the end the aircraft left tokyo haneda with a 90 minutes delay baggage drop off was smooth and was handled with japanese politeness if you have the choice to fly from nrt or hnd i  definitely choose hnd because it's much more conveniently located to downtown tokyo the aircraft was parked at a remote stand and we were bussed to the aircraft adding more time to the delay we already had i did not like the seats on the 777 i found them quite uncomfortable and the legroom was insufficient especially when you have an instant recline type passenger in front of you on the window and aisle seats there's also the ife box so there's no place for both feet the meal was a joke and there was no choise inflight entertainment is not up to date small screens with low brightness the crew was not very friendly when i went to the galley for a drink i was was urged to return to my seat instead of drinking in the galley and stretching my legs the second meal service was rushed we've got our meals and after 5 minutes the crew returned to pick up the trays because we were already descending to lhr  luckily i've made it to my connecting flight to amsterdam because i had a short connection the a320 flight to amsterdam departed ahead of schedule there's nothing special to write about this short flight although  round of drinks  have been nice unfortunately ba decided to cut the the service on european flights in the race to the bottom
 check notin at vienna airport was painless ba uses air lounge at vienna and was adequate with enough seating and food was okay boarding was a scrum as there was no priority given to club europe passengers the flight wasnt full therefore service was quite prompt i found the crew to be quite engaging and friendly and were happy to talk to the food was quite mediocre which consisted of afternoon tea scs and miniscule sandwiches one passenger wasnt very happy with the serving and the crew tried her hardest to explain what afternoon tea was business class was quite average to be hst will fly club europe again maybe depending on which route and price ba has a lot of catching up to do compare to other carrier within europe
 took a day trip to vienna with british-airways booked at the last minute flying out at 0720 on a sunday and having an early start to  to the airport i was looking forward to ting some sleep on the flight having never usually been a problem i boarded the aircraft and asked if it  be possible to  a pillow and blanket to be told by a member of crew that these are not for economy passengers – only business freezing temperature onboard the aircraft so managed to  limited sleep – another example of bas pathetic cost cutting antics and demonstrates the non notexistence of customer service within the airline despite it being  of the first flights out of heathrow with no queue for departure and perfect weather conditions – we still managed to arrive about 20 minutes late into vienna – quite as to how is beyond me i'll be sticking to easyjet until british-airways once again starts to value its passengers as currently they couldnt care less
  glasgow to heathrow ba are a disgrace it once stood for a high standard and flew the flag high my flight from islay was delayed by 2 hours no fault of mine so i missed my connecting flight after being fobbed off as not my fault nothing we can do i ended phoning and after an hour of being passed from pillar to post and british-airwaysck again i had to pay for another flight my grabbing company with lousy customer service and lack of any feeling
  london to phoenix this week having a window seat on the top deck your kind of rest assured you will have privacy and rest this was successful on the flight with 6 hours slept which was super comfortable which i was surprised at the meals were good and tasty with the service pleasant enough for ba the poorest part of the trip is the tv being so small and picture so poor in the end could not really use it as it was so frustrating amongst other operational issues ie press pause and film  start from beginning would i fly again sure why not
  glasgow to heathrow very disappointed in british-airways having been delayed by a partner airline and therefore missed the last connecting flight of the eve ba charged me and my friend full price to rebook for the morning their system had not allowed me to book all the way through using my ba exec club membership so i'd had to book it as two flights neither ba or loganair  take responsibility leaving us stranded at the airport for the night clearly being a member of the ba exec club counts for nothing very british-airwaysd customer service ba seems ba and loganair are only in partnership to extort more my from your passengers
  brussels to shanghai via london heathrow all flights on time clean aircraft food good cabin crew friendly  i recommend british-airways the only complaint i have is about the ground staff at heathrow i lost my jacket on the shanghai to london flight and ground staff at heathrow gave the mail address of a company for lost objects
  chicago to london heathrow i was dubious about flying ba especially after my last flight over a year ago  not after which i left the aircraft feeling very hungry however my trip to usa with ba was surprisingly very good both ways on this flight after deciding not to spend on an upgrade i was pleasantly surprised by being given a seat with extra leg room  not did not feel the need to  up and stretch my legs once although i slept a lot of the way the cabin crew were very helpful  not even asking the captain to find the direction of mecca so i could pray in my seat was given two british-airwaysgs of pretzels and two cups of coffee  not i had to ask for both but was given without any fuss a380 is a very nice aircraft and the take off and landing was excellent although i noticed a funny not that loud motorised noise coming form the galley noise of the journey for dinner there was butter chicken rice and lentils and a rice pudding type desert all of which was okay  not nothing special
  athens to philadelphia via london i chose ba because the fare was cheaper which explains why on a 3 hour 40 minute flight ath to lhr they do not serve food and beverages free on the aircraft having paid for our chosen seats there was no waste envelope whilst my inflight magazine was so overused lhr to phl an immaculate aircraft smooth flight all the way rather poor lunch i was disappointed with ba especially with their decision to charge for f&b on european flights
  hong kong to london heathrow on b777 in club world this was an interesting comparison as we had flown out to hk on an a350 on cathay pacific and the difference was huge the ba club world cabin is very cramped when compared with cathay the seat configuration is ok if you want to chat to your wife or friend but there is very little room to store items and just feels very cramped the duvets and blankets come in a british-airwaysg that is in the seat area which the crew insist on putting in the overhead lockers for take off this is fare enough but there is little room they also provide bottle of water which is great but again little storage area the food service was also disappointing the duck breast as my main course was very tough drinks selection was very good plus points go to the cabin crew who were very professional and had a sense of humour understand ba plan to change the business class seating in 2019 and this cannot come soon enough
  los angeles to london heathrow return  outbound first class return club world a380 both sectors awesome aircraft firstly ba flight deck crews are awesome totally professional and you know that they are tremendous pilots  the cabin crew on both sectors were polite friendly and professional their service was excellent i wasnt feeling well on the out bound flight and i didnt eat anything so i cant comment on the food on the return flight in club world the food was very good no complaints there the seats were comfortable although the club world cabin felt cramped i was in 53k which is a window rear facing bulk head seat as it was a daytime flight the noise coming from the galley didnt bother me but i think it  be an issue on night flights i hope ba change their business class seating for something like aa business class on their 777 not300s ba business class is really dated and i said it felt cramped my big issue and this isnt entirely bas fault was the over zealous security screening at heathrow i was pulled aside for screening 3 times i dont mind extensive in depth security but to be screened 3 times was excessive i am enrolled in and pay for tsa pre check and if british-airways  participate in this program it  save a lot of angst other than that the overall ba experience was totally acceptable
  hamburg to abu dhabi via london hamburg to heathrow not even a free glass of water or a candy everything is for purchase i felt cheated heathrow terminal 5 was a big mass getting from my arrival gate to the departure gate took me over 1hr within the same terminal security screening was extremely slow and staff rude i will avoid heathrow in the future long flight to abu dhabi was ok no frills in premium economy but edible food return flight was similar but heathrow terminal 5 less chaotic this time my last flight on ba was over 30 years ago it was a real premium carrier then 
  overnight club world flight from rio to london check in at rio was efficient third party lounge premium plaza which was reasonable and had enough space no fast track security lanes in rio plane ready near enough on time with well organized boarding on board standard club world service my feeling is that the food and beverage quality is not as good as it used to be granted they only loaded  of the wine options which was was not great either food itself not terribly appetizing breakfast quite rushed which it did not need to be given the long nature of the flight flight landed on time priority british-airwaysgs worked and were off quickly an average experience however ba were not the lowest cost option on this route at the time of booking that was air france not a carrier i rate highly but they were a direct flight
  london heathrow to vancouver the 747 on this route is an old worn out aircraft even though i paid for premium economy the seat was hard small and uncomfortable it  not recline without the air stewardess yanking the seat british-airwaysck the front foot rest was broken on  side so that during the whole flight my foot was tilted and slid off the touch on the british-airwaysck of the screen was small difficult to see and british-airwaysrely working the washroom had a leak and when i used it in the middle of the flight water was running along the floor and soaked my socks the air stewardess just gave a small laugh and said i shouldnt have worn socks there was no accessory pack of eye shades etc out of two meal choices  had run out after two rows had been served the  crew appeared bored and not bothered
 madrid to london credit where it's due flew club europe and the crew were excellent friendly attentive and professional the food was a good standard the b767 has a dedicated business class cabin with larger seats think they will be phased out this year but a good example of good service
 venice to gatwick i use snokart luggage which is designed to be zipped and fastened toher to allow skiers to check in  british-airwaysg only in feb of this year i was told by ba check in staff in venice that it is against their british-airwaysggage policy to allow luggage to be fastened toher the staff were clear that it is ba policy that british-airwaysgs cannot be fastened toher for nearly three months i have been asking the ba complaints team to provide evidence of this british-airwaysggage policy i have had several replies in that time but on each occasion the customer service staff have failed to provide evidence of the british-airwaysggage policy alleged by their check in staff in venice ba has also refused to confirm whether these two check in staff are in fact ba employees or employed by a third party this is very disappointing in what was a reputable company
 first 3 legs were trouble free lounges were good some staff were good some were very poor especially the agent i encountered at security in lhr my flight from singapore was delayed in the air and i was not allowed onto my connecting flight british-airways re notbooked me on the next flight but downgraded me from business to economy and into a centre seat fine i wanted to  home and they said they  compensate me after 3 weeks they finally mailed british-airwaysck to say they  refund the difference to my company who paid the ticket but i was not entitled to any even token gesture of frequent flyer miles for the inconvenience of being downgraded and put in an aisle seat after a long haul flight i missed out on a meal and the option to be comfortable and to try and catch up on further sleep it was all handled very poorly late and without regard to a frequent flyer who has the option to fly via air france or  of the middle east carriers who value my business its left me with a very sour taste in my mouth and i will certainly look at flying with other carriers now
 flew london to budapest with british-airways massively overpriced compared to other companies on this route like ryanair or easyjet with no real added value no drinks or food served on the flight the check notin process is just as painful and most of the time they force you to ckeck in your hand british-airwaysggage as well a bit more legroom but that wont justify the £200 price difference on a 2hr flight
  paid for a vueling airlines flight from florence to gatwick and bumped off flight when called british airways most unhelpful and told the flight had nothing to do with them even though i bought the ticket from british-airwayscom and had  flight number ba2058 a shocking attitude towards their paying customer
 london to sao paulo overnight club world flight prompt check in at heathrow and into lounge no spaces at the spa galleries lounges were fine and showers clean good wifi aircraft was a 777 not300 so in flight entertainment was good they also had wifi on board crew experienced and were good service prompt food reasonable and i liked the new white company offerings flight arrived early generally a solid performance
 worst ba flight ever flew tampa to london gatwick no greeting by the door shown to economy despite business seat dirty plane bits dangling from the ceiling only once all passengers were seated delay was announced and refuelling commenced which is a clear indication that delay was known earlier probritish-airwaysbly the worst business class seat around wobbly footrest facing strangers and having to climb over people breakfast was a single meagre roll with  tiny british-airwayscon slice and unbranded ketchup at disembritish-airwaysrkation the crew did help elderly passengers that was left to other passengers crew just stood there economy was not held british-airwaysck so no priority disembritish-airwaysrkation never again
 flew british-airways from london heathrow to dusseldorf despite being row 1 legroom was tiny no comparison to say eurowings which is a bud airline food terrible even worse was the seat this is not business class  expects a degree of comfort next time i will fly eurowings and  decent leg room with a table i can actually work on
  madrid to london the main plus about this flight were the cabin crew who were professional and friendly and hard working the i saw no food in the iberia lounge at madrid no working washrooms and discourteous iberia staff the food on board was ludicrous in business i got a panini  not the staff looked embritish-airwaysrrassed to serve it waste of my 
  london to moscow british-airways has downgraded their plane to a smaller plane and hence seat in business class is no longer club world flat bed seat but club europe seat not flat bed it is a night flight and this change is important and not acceptable i cannot fly during the day as i have meetings scheduled ba has not offered a like for like change they offered seats on an early flight next morning which is not suitable as this flight is during the day moreover the fare that we paid for the night flight was more expensive that those that ba is offering during the day they also not allowing me to cancel the flight and rebook another or change the outbound flight to another date like friday when the seat whether club world or club europe is less important as saturday not a working day and  can  a rest in summary it is unacceptable that ba is charging more for the flights with club world seat and then swapping it to smaller plane without offering a like for like change this was never the case before and ba was fair previously
  miami to london my most recent ba experience was positive i fly ba for work and leisure up to 4 long haul flights a year on my most recent flight from miami to lhr i found the whole economy experience well above average despite the dated aircraft the 747 not400 which to me is the legend of the skies the cabin crew in economy were smart attentive and seemed to go beyond the call of duty giving an elite service from the mia ground handling american crew food and beverage service was good seating in my aisle seat 29e generous for my long legs i recently flew ba business/ club world to the far east for work and despite the unlimited catering and frills the cabin staff lacked the attention and friendliness of this flight well d ba you excel against the north american carriers on routes to the north american gateways who give just a british-airwayssic service
  gatwick to barbritish-airwaysdos in december 2017 on a 9 hour flight they provided  meal and afternoon tea which consisted of a mars british-airwaysr and a cup of tea the plane was aging and yellowing round the edges and the staff were surly the only redeeming thing was that it was cheaper than competitors but still not cheap
  london heathrow to dallas the aircraft was old no sign of refurbishment for the last 10 years or so seat pocket was full of rubbish from previous flight the personal screen is tiny and no longer responsive as a touch screen so i had to use the remote control which is fixed on the armrest and non retractable the choice of ife is very limited the food on both outbound and inbound flights were mediocre and with small portion i saw some passengers request for more food and i was glad to see the crew giving out nicely without attitude i must admit that the crew on the outbound were exceptional whilst the inbound were acceptable but still better than most crew on flights to/from jfk i had an onward connecting flight with american airlines and i can clearly see the changes between the 2 airlines over the past few years whilst aa is improving ba is becoming a national embritish-airwaysrrassment ba remains among the most greedy airlines when it comes to seat selection the seat selection price tag just makes the total cost higher than other decent airlines it no longer deserves a 4 notstar rating but edging between 2 or 3 star it's not even worth redeeming avios points anymore these days i'd rather spend my avios on partner airlines
 decided to go in club europe for this relatively short flight 90 minutes from london to copenhagen dropped my british-airwaysgs and went through security which did not take too long i then went to the galleries lounge south and although i have not been there for a year or two it looked the same same food same drinks same slow wifi my gate was just around the corner and i got on the plane i like the fresh look inside but the seat pitch is ridiculous in business the food service was disappointing the service in the cabin was ok but not very warm i have travelled a lot with ba over the past 20 years after yesterda i have lost my faith in british-airways
 ba used to be a byword for quality and service you simply cant say that anymore and the only thing that seems to have stayed the same is the ticket price i paid 600 dollars for my ticket from istanbul to london with ba for that price there is no airbridge you will wait on a crowded bus and no entertainment note: this is a 4 hour flight also screen devices larger than a ph are british-airwaysnned from this flight so no alternative of watching movies on your ipad oh and youll have to buy any food and drinks on board i flew ba on this route because no other flight time worked for me however turkish airlines is by far the better option with airbridge free hot meals and a modern entertainment system pegasus and atlasglobritish-airwaysl offer a similar service to ba but at far lower prices it seems to be the same all over ba used to be a first choice but at this price for this service its become a last resort
 premium economy worse than most airlines economy unprofessional staff uncomfortable seats foot rest but no leg rest very little seat recline and difficult to operate rubbish food very poor landing and everything went flying additionally we were a family of 4 travelling toher but split up and 3 of us were seated between two of the four toilets that serve 160 people these “premium economy” seats are directly outside the toilet doors which meant an entire night kept awake with the noise and light from the loos other airlines have toilet lights that dim until you lock the door to avoid flooding the cabin with light  not not ba even the staff kept leaving the toilet doors open after they went in to blow their nose or check their teeth or makeup this was the second leg on a flight from sydney via lax so we were beyond tired when an attendant picked up my sons water at the end of the very long and sleepless flight he didnt hear my son say “thanks” which he had so the attendant said pointedly “youre welcome  not rude” and laughed about it with the passenger next to him in my experience better and cheaper premium economy can be found with norwegian air new zealand and american airlines  not all of whom also allow seat selection without additional charge ive never had cause for complaint with any of those airlines but with british-airways ive never had a good experience
 flew belfast to london with british-airways stressful day started with a 25 hours delay for the morning flight at 7am as an apology they sold us the food and the drinks yes they asked for my even though we were stuck on the airplane for over three hours seriously if you can find an alternative to travel within the uk do it not very countable if you have a connected flight
 naples to gatwick the online check notin  not work for me in accordance with the one world frequent flyer policy i am a qantas frequent flyer and so i ought to have had the chance to check notin a few days ahead of the flight the ba website  not let me do so the british-airwaysg notdrop in naples was slow and seemed rather random boarding was tedious i should have had priority as a frequent flyer and had to show my frequent flyer card in the mean time other passengers were allowed through the boarding gate which proved to be misleading as a transfer bus was needed boarding was chaotic and passengers had far too much hand luggage the cabin crew were quite indifferent i greeted 2 cabin crew when i boarded and neither of them smiled british-airwaysck i bought a marks and spencer drink at an inflated price one of the crew moved my small british-airwaysg in the overhead locker and at the end of the flight when i went to collect my british-airwaysg it has been ripped by the luggage of another passenger disembritish-airwaysrkation was slow and british-airwaysdly managed nobody from the crew fare welled the passengers ba has become a low notcost airline in its service and given the cost of the ticket and the charge for a british-airwaysg i will not be using them again in a hurry
 i have been flying with ba for the last 32 years between sao paulo and london on and off but mostly ba i have travelled in all classes except first ba used to be a very good airline and stand out from most but now they look like a low cost airline with high cost fares not value for my the food and drinks are parsimonious to the extend of me having to ask for a drink even in business i flew out club and returned economy plus staff on board are still the usual arrogant and discretely rude no changes there boarding has become indifferent and they group classes in 5 different queues of travel so we have become just a number service is not exclusive anymore seats on the 777 not300 wear hard and uncomfortable including the beds on club their lounge performance is very poor also with food option variety in case of food allergies/intolerances really british-airwaysd and of poor quality it is a shame singapore airlines does not fly to brazil from the uk as they definitely offer top quality service especially on their business class ba has become mean greedy and indifferent to their customers and i feel it is time for the ceo to go as he is ruining the image of the airline the changes on british-airwaysggage weight has become silly also i was allowed two luggages of 23kg any sensible person  allow me to pass with  luggage at 27kg and  of 10kg as i have not go above the allowance i am entitled instead i had to reshuffle my contents from the big luggage to the small luggage to make it 23 and 14 in my opinion unnecessary as i had 37 kgs in total and not 47kg so i will in future re notthink my trips to brazil even if i have to make my journey longer as i am after good service value for my and a differentiated experience thumbs down to ba
 i traveled on british-airways with my wife from dallas to lagos nigeria via london on february 23 2018 i had an extra british-airwaysg that i paid $200 for in dallas our flight got delayed in dallas therefore we missed our flight to lagos when we got to london we went to the ba counter to explain our situation and find a solution and they decided to put us on a virgin atlantic flight to lagos on ting to virgin atlantic counter we were told that we have to pay for the british-airwaysg again and request for a refund from ba we decided to do that i opened a case on ba website explaining what happened and requested for a refund as what happened was their fault and not mine they refused to issue the refund claiming that each airline has their own british-airwaysggage policy i know this but what happened was not my fault but theirs that was the last time i heard from them on the issue even the economy premium was a waste of my nothing special such a disappointment never again
 flew british-airways from budapest to london heathrow quite possibly the worst flight i have ever had and i travel often generally when we travel we try to pack our hand british-airwaysggage light as we check our heavier british-airwaysgs and it's more convenient for other passengers too my partner and i had 2 briefcase notsized british-airwaysgs between us that fit nicely in the overhead locker as more passengers boarded most with as notlarge notas notpossible carryons the overhead lockers filled up the flight attendant walks up to the overhead locker above our heads takes out our british-airwaysgs hands them to us and says i'm sorry but the space is needed for large british-airwaysgs telling us to put them underneath the seat in front of us reducing our leg room to zero how is this at all fair i questid why we should lose our leg room as a result of having smaller carry notons and was given the response that i  delay the flight if the british-airwaysgs had to be offloaded i have no idea who at ba thought it  be a good policy to hand out the yellow tags that mean thank you for bringing smaller carry notons than every else as a measure of our appreciation we'll take away your leg room the general decorum of the flight attendants also deserves a mention young adults british-airwaysrely out of high school and who  be more suited to making coffees in a road services starbucks such was their experience at providing pleasant service what a sad state of affairs i will never ever travel british-airways willingly again long haul or short haul i  rather take a civilised  notstop journey with lufthansa and arrive in a pleasant frame of mind than endure the persistent dirty feeling of a direct british-airways flight
 the air conditioning didnt work in the part of the airplane where we were sitting and it was very hot i had to stand in the british-airwaysck of the airplane where it was cooler it was an 8 hours flight from london heathrow to new york jfk overall the airplane was old with little space to seat there was no wi notfi the leg/seating space was very small i wish that food  be more taste neutral if your child doesnt like spicy or flavored foods/snacks there  be nothing to eat the stewardesses were most helpful and their service was outstanding landing was smooth the ba staff made us to check in our british-airwaysgs even they were carry on there are measuring boxes where you should be able to stick your luggage in and these boxes are very small also the airport security was overly zealous  not they had to search kids british-airwaysg and they found roll noton deodorant and checked it for fumes 
  my british-airwaysg was damaged on a ba flight in december 2017 all looked good when i got to the airport customer services counter  not was told it  be replaced and they gave me a number to call i called this number when home and it's a 3rd party company called k2 they will only replace with a poor quality british-airwaysg that is not the same as the  they damaged despite it being in excellent condition and hardly used i raised this with ba who refused to offer like notfor notlike replacement i got nowhere with them after hours on hold numerous times 4 months later i decide that something is better than nothing and call k2 to  the british-airwaysg they offered me only to find that ba have closed my case and they wo not send  finally  through to ba and they finally agree to put me british-airwaysck to k2 to  the british-airwaysg offered if i want to upgrade what they offer i will have to pay it myself i wont hold my breath but it is supposed to arrive on tuesday i  not fly again unless i had no other viable option
 efficient check in helpful staff advised on best lounge option for our flight decided to opt for premium economy as only 4 hour flight from london heathrow to cairo galleries south lounge was relatively quiet good range of snacks including an afternoon tea offering which was quite good showers clean and well presented chaotic boarding well presented aircraft staff in premium economy cabin offered welcome drink slightly delayed departure time made up en route unable to order main course for meal on line but got choice of meal which was totally acceptable efficient staff and good inflight entertainment happy with whole experience i dont think i  use over club world for a long flight but for a flight where you dont need to sleep it was fine
  st lucia to gatwick as this was a night flight we decided to fly business so we might  some sleep and i now wish we'd saved the extra that it cost a complete waste of my the cabin is very dated and cramped it was not clean half a biscuit down the side of my seat and plastic british-airwaysgs on the floor and the service and food were average at best why in this day and age do ba persist with having seats with no direct aisle access not that i could  comfortable enough to sleep anyway the seat was adequate and no more the entertainment system screen was small and the touch screen was very clunky needing very firm contact to  any response on top of this there was no usb point to charge my ph i expected better cabin service than we got not offered tea or coffee after dinner and it seemed to be a case of asking for anything that was needed rather than being offered it  not i certainly do not expect to have to remind the flight attendant about the cup of tea requested 15 minutes earlier all in all it was an education certainly taught me a lesson
  fort lauderdale to gatwick an efficient courtesy bus took us from car rentals terminal 1 to the international terminal terminal 4 check notin was friendly security staff insisted on using a whole notbody scanner for every and were overly officious surprisingly there was no business class lounge although there was plenty of sitting space before the gates in the redeveloped terminal boarding was according to group rather than priority which caused some annoyance club world was in two smaller cabins with the usual outdated eight seats abreast take notoff was on time the wrong menus had been loaded so the actual menu was announced over the tannoy drinks and food service served efficiently food adequate and not overcooked but below the standard of turkish airlines seats hard and uncomfortable for sleeping with the usual issue of having to climb over legs if in a window seat abbreviated breakfast no hot option served an hour before landing arrived 30 mins ahead of schedule overall an adequate flight but the inflight experience was well below ba's competitors
  dubritish-airwaysi to london heathrow it's british-airwaysd that ba requests additional payment to select seats before the check notin if flying solo it's not a big issue but with any companion in this case i was with my son of 10 it  have been an issue to be separate this also means that if there are 3 or 4 flights and a group of two as in my case the difference  be substantial up to approx 1000$ lucky enough at least on the return flight we were able to select the middle seats because the flight was not full on board service was decent professional courteous and friendly attendants toilets in the second half of the flight were not too clean flat seats in business class are outdated but comfortable for a nice sleep the aircraft did not have wifi
 london to las vegas disappointed at ba  not flights were delayed my partner took the same outbound flight on a different day and was delayed as well by 2 not3hrs aircraft interior was outdated unclean and uncomfortable seats with very small legroom space no safety video which was surprising as most long haul flights include this food was tasteless and i did skip a meal in the end  not during  of the snack times we were not given the options by our fa but the guy sat next to us who was served by another fa was given different options inflight entertainment poor with very limited choices and monitors were very old to ensure that i sit with my partner on the return flight we paid to reserve our seats  not not impressed by this especially when we realised that the legroom space for my partner was obstructed by a broke ife box which was loosely fitted so the door kept opening taking his legroom space as well as exposing the cables in the box which if you knocked it down  affect his monitor  learnt our lessons next time we will not fly ba
  tampa to gatwick i am a disabled traveller with considerable mobility issues as i usually travel al i can find it extremely difficult however from the moment i arrived at the check in desk in tampa i was met with the utmost courtesy and assistance from the check in clerk at business class waving me forward to use his terminal things just went from excellent to exceptional i was helped to put my suitcase onto the conveyor scale and assisted with every step of the way until the aircraft door every person was polite helpful and went out of their way to make my journey as pleasant as possible i witnessed such kindness and this is what i have come to expect and value from british-airways having used other airlines in the past  not i am converted  not i will not use any other airline in future
  heathrow to keflavik i had booked economy was pleasantly surprised to be upgraded when i checked in online  priority boarding worked well and even though the flight was full there was no overhead locker range the inflight meal was prawns was generous along with a good selection of wine off loading was straightforward the return flight was on time the pre booked emergency seat had more leg room the premium seat m&s food service was ok the cabin crews were slow at taking payment overall similar experience to an easyjet flight
  london to muscat first class first time trying out first class on ba check notin was fairly quick and efficient did not have much luggage but the first wing did not feel very exclusive i had selected window seat in advance and this was confirmed and still intact as i got printed boarding pass concorde room was nice well designed but quite crowded in some places had to ask for a champagne two times out in the terrace before it got served a good 20 minutes later checkout out the cabritish-airwaysna for an hour which was not very appealing at all and managed to miss the first 5 min of the 15min treatment i booked for the spa onboard was informed there was a problem with the seat i had selected and was issued a new aisle seat which was disappointing upon entering the first class cabin i had a quick look at the seat and it was not immediately apparent there was something wrong i asked a crew to check and they came british-airwaysck to confirm that i will indeed not be able to sit there but there was no explanation of what was wrong given i did not want to waste any time to settle in the crew looking after me introduced himself and served me champagne and warm nuts as well as offering some magazines to read seat was comfortable and spacious enough and seemed fairly private with a small wardrobe to hang jacket the tv screen seemed quite large and high quality unfortunately the seat controls were not super responsive and neither was the remote for the tv soon after take off i was informed i could eat when i like arabic starter was great had pre notselected main meal online meal was of good quality and cooked well had a dessert and the mixed cheese plate not as good as other cheese i've had in some business class surprisingly the entertainment system had a rather limited selection i imagine on two ultra notlong flights in the same month  might run out of anything of interest to watch after finishing the  film i decided to watch i decided to try  some sleep crew made the bedding while i tried to put on the pyjamas in the tiny first class british-airwaysthroom bedding was of good quality and comfortable enough i missed breakfast as i was still rather full from the dinner and pre notdinner at the lounge overall i was reasonably happy with the flight and the product the crew were very friendly and professional given this was first class have to admit there was no wow factor either with the soft product or ground experience i managed to book flights for a good price during a promo otherwise it  personally not be worth the price tag for a fairly short flight
  my family and i travelled from cape town to london on the 10th march 2018 we have a 1 year old and a 4 year old once seated we realised that our entertainment system was not working the cabin light for all seats that we had booked were not working either there was minimal effort from the cabin team to try and resolve this as it was a night flight my wife and i had to see to our 1 year old in the dark any help we needed required us to walk to the galley to receive any assistance as bas safety demonstration prior to take off is on video we did not receive this the flight was the worst airline experience we've had i doubt i'll ever fly with ba again
  gatwick to madeira the flight left on time and arrived early slept as early morning flight the plane was not very clean grubby tray between seats and ingrained dirt in the spokes of the seats the staff were pleasant breakfast was offered and my children felt it was adequate the return was poorly organised no use of fast track security for business class passengers long queue for boarding and a grubby plane really no point in paying for business class the staff try so very hard to please the passengers but nearly 4 hours and no entertainment dog noteared magazines  quickly disembritish-airwaysrked and swiftly through immigration
 london to casablanca their customer service quality in heathrow terminal 3 is very patchy for british-airwaysckground my initial flight was with tap portugal which got cancelled then rebooked to ba my second flight had further issue and instead of requesting tap to rebook me ba took the liberty of rebooking a 3rd flight for me  not which turned out to be overbooked this then caused me having to liaise with both tap and ba to rebook my 4th flight  not i was tossed around by both customer care telling me it's not their problem tap can no longer rebook me on another flight as they have lost the right to alter the ticket as soon as ba rebooked me on the 3rd flight i was initially served by a very helpful staff who attends to my rebooking issue  not the last flight i was rebooked was overbooked however later on i was passed on to a couple of rude staff that were reluctant to serve me as it was 15 minutes past their end of shift they were also talking about me in front of me and accused me of taking advantage of ba this is very rude and extremely unprofessional i've never had this treatment during my 10+ years of flying with various airlines both top rated and low cost carrier
 british-airways flight manager is very professional i travelled on ba985 from berlin to hong kong via london on 19 feb due to the snowy weather my flight leaving berlin to london was delayed in which i was worried about missing my connecting flight from london to hong kong during the flight the manager came to me several times explained to me the reason of flight delay informed me about the connecting flight arrangements her information was very clear trusted she has been working closely with airport ground on this very much appreciated for their service
 hyderabritish-airwaysd to brussels via london did not expect this from british-airways for me quality hit the rock bottom especially the unclean flight i  have preferred the aircraft from brussels to london and vice versa for the long haul travel maybe my expectations was too high but considering the price i paid for ticket i think it's not worth it other airline which i used to travel had the same price and if i compare the services of that ariline i regret choosing british-airways
 london gatwick to fort lauderdale is  of ba's new long nothaul routes and clearly designed to cater for winter sun seekers from september 2018 the gatwick fleet will be 'densified' with an horrific ten across in economy and a reduced club world the 777 not200 on our flight was of the bog notstandard 90s vintage which meant 48 pax squeezed into the club world cabin and every having to make do with the ancient small screen low resolution ife that required the usual rebooting but there were positive aspects to the flight: a young and efficient cabin crew the improved club world food service with plates brought individually to 's seat and arrival ahead of schedule although this was let down by the delayed disembritish-airwaysrkation that's commonplace at fort lauderdale terminal 4 overall an entirely reasonable flight
"  milan to london heathrow the service and cleanliness has hit rock bottom at ba i am flying with them very frequently and this last trip was testament that they have lost passion the response was we are not responsible for cleaning the plane
"
  london to helsinki business class friday 23rd march i thought service in the sky had died out as a frequent flyer i havent felt the needed to complain nor commend until now i had to say something to say thank you for  of the most pleasurable flights i have ever had this is old school airline service puts the glamour and luxury british-airwaysck into air travel cabin staff made me feel like i was the only person they were serving i loved the humour the way they made it so personal and the fact they took such great care of my daughter who is as fussy as fussy comes 
  london heathrow to denver words cannot express my gratitude and appreciation for the lovely crew that worked so hard to make sure i was comfortable on my latest flight; but here it goes i was very sick/nauseas from food poisoning on a different airline and the staff off british-airways literally nursed me british-airwaysck to health they were beyond wonderful and were genuinely caring and concerned i never once felt like a burden even though they were checking on me often world class crew again so thankful for people like this especially in my time of need and  highly recommend this airline to every
 it was a 13 hours flight from heathrow to kuala lumpur with british-airways and it was my first long haul flight with absolutely no meals served during the dinner i was sleeping so you could say that it was my fault for not staying awake for the breakfast the flight was 20 minutes ahead of schedule so they were in a rush serving the meals up until 40 minutes before landing they were still serving i waited for my turn but no food came so i asked instead of them explaining and apologising i had to ask where is my food they said that they ran out of food because they only cater for 80% of the passengers assuming some will be asleep the cabin crew were very nice he apologised and passed me a feedbritish-airwaysck form which i have filled in while i understand that this airline does not want to waste food and i liked their act of putting an envelope for you to donate to kids in need it is not very nice when you are a passenger who receives no food for 13 hours also it was also my first time seeing the cabin luggage space be occupied by the luggage of a cabin crew i thought they should have their own it was also my first time waiting at the toilet for at least 10 minutes and out it came a cabin crew very interesting experience
  worst business class i flew you are facing a stranger for the entire flight also every time the crew have to service a passenger next to me i have to stop eating and crew has to serve in front of my face dreadful food a very dated 777 plane and  uninterested staff the british-airwaysr on board was supposed to have full range of mid flight snack and sandwiches but apparently they ran out and the reason from cabin crew said people are taking too much food they also ran out of the appetiser i was told sorry we ran out of satay and other passengers have already ordered them therefore please select another option 
  beijing to london service at the british-airways business class counter at beijing airport was pleasant the business lounge was quiet when we were there however food options were very limited we were there in the morning the food options for breakfast were hot meals or some plain toast or a couple of sandwich options onboard service was really good quite personal and attentive which made a difference from the service on the way out to beijing food was as good a you'd expect to  on board i managed to  a window seat which made a difference with regards to being able to sleep on board entertainment options were good
  london to beijing left from t5 at heathrow service is very speedy you can use the fast track entrance which is swift i did not think much of the business lounge food was more like canteen food we were there around lunchtime i ended up just having some salad and a packet of crisps later around 3pm they brought out some sandwiches this was preferable than the food that was on offer at lunchtime there were many drinks available wine was ok i tried to plug in my tablet to charge it and n of the plugs seemed to be working this was also disappointing with regards to the service on board the flight it was ok however they collected my breakfast card but not my husbritish-airwaysnds so he nearly missed out on breakfast the next morning they offered my husbritish-airwaysnd a bread roll but not me it seemed there was not much structure to the service which meant they missed things the entertainment that was available was good
  bangkok to london the worst long haul carrier i have flown with a very disappointing experience starting with the booking & customer service department who failed to adhere to their price promise policy the flights served the worst food the boeing 777 i flew on was very dated and had power outlets for charging phs & portable devices the seats were uncomfortable for such a long haul flight and due to the lack of leg room you could feed the knees of the passenger behind pushing into my british-airwaysck for the duration of the journey meals were very spread out leaving passengers with no meals or snacks for 8+ hours when i mentid to the onboard staff i was hungry i was informed there are no snacks available and a meal  be served shortly before landing staff overall were uninterested and unhelpful the dated screens which the in flight entertainment was shown on were very small and blurry with unresponsive touch screens
 food on this 4+ hours flight from moscow to heathrow was a filled roll and 1 cup of tea/coffee the other london notmoscow flights provide a full meal the cabin staff were almost robotic and programmed in the discharge of their duties with no interaction with passengers when the flight touched down it was 75 minutes before we disembritish-airwaysrked 6 british-airways flights that landed after us discharged their passengers whilst our flight waited first at a stand and then 15 minutes for an air bridge operator my email to their ceo produced nothing except a plastic apology even though the captain continually said we were waiting on find the guy responsible for stand allocation used to be ba was a world leader they've followed the empire and dinosaurs into extinction
 flew london heathrow to delhi airport terminal 5 concorde room is impressive clean but lacks service had to wait for over 20 mins for waiting staff to come and attend when boarding the plane  not no  to escort you to the seat as you know there are only 8 first class seats in b787 not9 when it comes to meal choice the main course i had selected non veg indian dish was not available when questid why  not i was told sorry today we only loaded 3 of those dishes and other passengers have already ordered them therefore please select another option so i skipped the main meal i reminded the stewardess that i am not an upgrade passenger i paid full price it is shame that ba is flying with less than 50% food choice for their premium passengers i have never faced this situation with virgin or emirate and have decided never to fly with ba if i can help
two regular an uneventful flights curiously enough though with the exact same crew the crew were very nice and the service is very attentive and polite but i just cannot take it that british-airways has chosen to provide a service just like low cost carriers where everything is charged for apart from luggage on the second leg of the trip the aircraft felt extremely warm and for some odd reason row 6 where i was sitting did not have ac
 london to belfast another regular flight by british-airways which has turned into a low cost airline given the total no frills service they provide the staff are extremely nice and polite but in the short haul flights you only  luggage the flight went perfectly departing and arriving on time
 very full flight on g notbnlp/b747 flying from miami to london according to basourcecom this plane was built in 1990 obviously since then it was not refurbished felt like a teenager again worn seats cracks in the walls and dirty additonally the ife did not work at the same time no reading lights as controlled by inflight entertainment as the night approached crew turned off reading lights and cabin lights no ife and no book reading possible crew were young and friendly but obviously not experienced took 25 hours until we had our meal after take notoff  not they skipped our last four rows only after inquiring we got a tray on arrival new contractor at terminal 3 and no jetbridge driver available needed to wait 20 minutes until some arrived overall poor experience with british-airways they used to be good but they try to be low notcost and charge legacy carrier prices will not work to fly to serve is no more adequate as their slogan
 warsaw to london waw is not a pleasant airport and the  lounge after passport control “bolero” is always overcrowded so that benefit of flying club is not worth much at this airport ba have changed their boarding process to group numbers and it went smoothly seat in club europe is a standard coach class seat on a very tight pitch  not frankly its pretty poor to sell this as a business class product with such seats the service was very good attentive and prompt the food served was also good with a choice of main course appetizer desert and cheese course with drinks flowing frankly well above expected
  i booked my flight with cathay pacific  the route between stockholm and london was operated by british-airways for a 25 hour flight they do not offer anything free on board there was no individual screen or usb charge at the seat for this short european flight
 flew british-airways from lisbon to london heathrow uneventful flight the crew were very pleasant when welcoming the passengers but then seemed like they were doing every a favor by being there they should smile and be a little more considerate however the check notin lady was nice and we had a laugh my problem with ba for a while now is that it has become a low cost airline for shorter flights
 singapore to heathrow i skipped my meal on board and have requested for the small bottle of water that was served with the meal the air stewardess indicated that there were spare bottles behind and she will bring me a bottle afterwards which never came when i asked another air steward for a bottle of water he told me they do not have spare bottled water besides the  that came with the meal was it that difficult to provide a small bottle of water on a flight
  chicago to chennai via london the pilot and captain were top class  not the flight was delayed by more than 4 hours  not but they made it up to 2 hours and was smooth chicago check in staff unfriendly it took them 28 minutes to serve 2 of us the only thing they tried was to upsell me into first class meals  not excellent choices veg or non veg is all the crew asked business  my co passenger asked for a menu  not answer  not you are booked for veg meal  not so that will be served he asked for drinks menu  not answer  not what do you want  the seat was claustrophobic  closed and uncomfortable the crew was unsmiling
 flew london heathrow to toronto i am a frequent traveller but this was the first time i have traveled with british-airways and it did not disappoint me the flight departed on time and caused no extra delays whatsoever despite the dreadful weather conditions in toronto the cabin crews were wonderful and the service were great the seat are not the most comfortable for a long haul flight but the value for my is good too
 i flew british-airways from heathrow to hong kong in club world on a a380 they have recently introduced the new club world service on this route and it was a complete disaster it took 3 hours and 20 minutes to serve the food on an overnight flight they ran out of champagne and some of the food was even served cold the cabin crew were generally unresponsive and didnt seem to care much about providing a decent service to premium clients overall it was probritish-airwaysbly my worst experience in business class and the new ba concept doesnt seem to work well it was even criticised by the crew during the flight i am gold on ba and it may lead me to reconsider my airline choices in the future
" i flew british-airways from miami to heathrow on an airbus a380 the premium economy cabin is located on the upper deck i had a side seat with no  sitting next to me boarding was smooth and we left on time food and drink was fine apart from breakfast which consisted of a cream cheese roll which is not very pleasant any time and certainly not early in morning and a granary british-airwaysr which i did not eat my dog liked it when i got home for the price you  expect a better meal ife was fine crew good
"
  london to phoenix decided to pay to travel first class for a big birthday upon arrival at terminal 3 for check in i was disappointed to see no separate check in just a young girl with a could not care less attitude behind a temporary room divider off we went to the lounge and this was atrocious uninterested staff on the door huge dirty plastic floral arrangement on entry that should have been binned a long time ago the lounge looked like council offices hugely disappointing and the food offerings were not good on board was no better a scrum at the boarding gate so not called first  not was followed by a filthy seat a screen that  not stay up and a meal service that even the very nice onboard staff apologised for as she put it in front of me our return in club from new orleans was not much better no separate check in no lounge but a $30 voucher to use in the  british-airwaysr that is still open at this time of day again a filthy seat and a broken arm rest i love ba onboard crew in general but i will never fly ba again
 london to istanbul flying in ba's club europe is a miserable experience and i think they have the lowest standard of all european airlines the seats are economy class seats with no legroom; the only difference is that the middle seat is kept free service and food are mediocre when will ba  its act toher and return to acceptable standards
 i have traveled several times with british-airways but only in long haul trips those have been pretty good this time i had to fly from edinburgh to london gatwick and i end up with mix feelings ground service in edinburgh was outstanding expeditious friendly and they gave me the chance to check a second british-airwaysg without any extra charge service on board was average but friendly departure was on time and we arrived 20 minutes earlier so very well the plane was an airbus 319 in pretty good shape clean and well maintained however the space between seats was simply ridiculous it was extremely small even for a midsize person there  not be a chance to open a laptop and try to work happily the person in front of me did not recline that could have been a disaster very british-airwaysd of course there was no entertainment there was food and beverages for purchase due to the space between seats i  avoid flying with ba in short haul flights
 could british-airways  any worse flew chicago  not london heathrow in upper deck / club world of ancient b747 not400 british-airways business class is the worst in the entire globritish-airwaysl airline industry the seats are the crazy / odd facing each other with a rude screen and are terribly uncomfortable / narrow they must be at least a decade out of date the food / wine was simply awful and they did not have the lamb on the menu but replaced it with some kind of beef mush the crew were young uneducated and unprofessional they were waiters and waitresses at best and did not seem to have the social skills requisite to serving business people club class on this route was also full of screaming children  of whom threw up on the flight why do ba hold their premium customers in such contempt i can give you the answer: they have a monopoly from the uk to the usa and british-airwaysck and no legitimate competition 
 flew on british-airways from athens to london the aircraft was a boeing 757 at the age of 20 years the aircraft showed its age inside and outside as well as the seating apart from this we were slightly delayed leaving but caught up time in flight so landed on time unfortunately ba has adopted the low cost airline mentality of having to buy food and drinks which is a shame as they used to be a lovely airline but i guess we will need to live with it as prices are competitive
 the best thing about this flight from london heathrow to miami was its punctuality however having got up at 5am for the flight time at 1045 if we hadnt eaten breakfast in the airport we  have been starving by the lunch service which was served what seemed like a long time after take off 6 hours after the mediocre lunch were were served an even more mediocre sandwich only  cabin staff for premium economy service meant drinks and meals were served very slowly by the hard worked lady aircraft an elderly 747 and showing its age screen tiny scratched and hardly worth looking at we have flown similar routes on thomas cook and tui planes and the service and comfort of their new aircraft was miles ahead of this ba flight which i think is shameful for the national carrier
  i've been flying to bombritish-airwaysy for the last seven years to teach there for most of those seven years i have flown jet but decided to try ba this time terminal 5 heathrow flowed smoothly from kerbside to the gate boarding was disappointing because there was no discipline in how the aircraft was boarded logic suggests you board from the british-airwaysck of the aircraft but when i questid  of the staff i was told they had stopped doing this over two years ago  the flight was smooth the seat significantly more comfortable than jet's the food good and the service great the steward who looked after my area was both friendly and authoritative in economy class i can only book my seat 24 hours before takeoff i can book the seat of my choice earlier if i wish to pay and that was what i wanted to do with my avios points but you cannot  i was told that several executive club members and avios point collectors had made the same complaint and that ba might consider allowing its customers to reserve seats with avios points ba judging from this experience does not know whether it is a full notexercise or a low notcost airline 
 flew short haul business class with british-airways manchester  not gothenburg via london heathrow it's a diffcult  to review some aspects of the travel were excellent and others unacceptable we used points to travel so what we paid was fine though  never pay a full ba business short haul fee we have family in sweden so took 70kgs gifts etc of luggage with us for our four night trip check notin was fine both ends all fights on nottime just about and no luggage issues a positive the staff were friendly though clearly demoralised and actively encouraged to email/publish our concerns we had a mixture of fortunes with the catering man notlhr nice cold meat platter 30 min flight lhr notgot three dried up finger sandwiches no alternative offered were told could not take from the m&s menu in economy either one reason for this because we ordered an asian veg meal once years ago and apparently this stays on the system i was told to change my profile details on ba site  not once home i looked it clearly says meal options  not n ie no special menu confusing to say the least thus the catering became an issue on the remaining three flights we were told in economy you had to purchase everything even water however if in an emergency tap water could be provided  not so much for a full notservice airline any newspapers also g from business class on lhr notgot route there was no divide put up between business and economy so a 'free for all' to the front toilet leg room not great even fully paying business class passengers have to purchase a seat more than 24h in advance £21 for the frist row and £18 for the rest which is ridiculous if you had paid £400 return lounges ok  not preferred man to lhr which is busy and looking worn already the down notscaling of ba and the mix of pretending to be a full notservice airline but having bud airline ideals and practices is both confusing and not on the fas were a saving grace though rest assured they are not happy we'll use up our existing points though definiately not our airline of choice
 flew london heathrow to prague bad service had to check in the hand luggage at the gate despite being bronze arrogant staff not to mention the old story of no complimentary refreshments i fly the route a few times a month british-airways sometimes uses airport bus instead of air bridge and there are frequent delays whats the difference between ryanair and ba again please ah the price the only reason i give 2/10 is because the plane has reclining seats and got us there safely
  new orleans to hyderabritish-airwaysd via london i booked my flight ticket couple of moths before my travel and i received an email on the day i'm going to travel saying that my flight was cancelled and they asked me to book my ticket for the next day this destructed all my plans i have an interview to attend which is very important i gave a call to the customer service and they really did not gave me any options after couple of hours over the call i am very frustrated and they gave an option to fly from msy to dfw and london and hyd and the layover is very short and i am very tense as i do not have any options to choose this whole journey was very irritating and the customer service is really british-airwaysd 
 delayed 2 hours on outbound flight to athens due to lateness of aircraft and then due to technical issues no tea or coffee offered while on business on that flight extremely dated aircraft meal offered was good cancelled inbound flight to london due to technical issues of aircraft hotel and compensation offered no entertainment during the next days new flight in general british-airways has no customer satisfaction anymore unfortunately i fly with them cause i have to it has become an unreliable average airline
 a fairly average flight to cape town and return the old 777s they use out of gatwick are incredibly dated but the economy seats are fairly comfortable the tv screen is very small and fuzzy and had to be reset on the journey home to  it working but the selection of entertainment is ok the food has noticeably improved since last time we flew with british-airways long haul and all meals were tasty and a decent size and it was nice to receive a hot breakfast before arrival on both journeys as always with ba the crew were mixed – some were helpful and really friendly others were borderline rude however i  probritish-airwaysbly still choose ba to cape town in order to fly direct
  las vegas to london heathrow really poor food i am little fussy with my food but my partner will eat anything and even he  not eat what we were served the breakfast wrap of turkey bacon or mushroom and spinach they both smelt revolting and i did not even try mine but my partner had a bite and could not eat anymore chicken curry was questionable or again spinach lasagne  not just because some may not choose to eat meat does not mean they what spinach with every meal there are some very nice alternatives out there we were not offered tea or coffee at any point and found the staff inattentive i  think twice before traveling with ba again i thought they were meant to be our flagship airline
 flew ba 1311 on february 10th from aberdeen to london heathrow check in was fast and efficient as was the boarding process i really like the new group boarding structure the lunch offered on board was good cabin crew were very attentive we arrived in london heathrow terminal 5 approx 10 minutes ahead of schedule however it took my luggage over 25 minutes to arrive overall very good with the exception of late arrival of luggage
  dusseldorf to london very satisfied with ba reasonable fares on time awesome cabin staff going to the uk they are my favourite airline in club europe i miss better seating and more leg room as first priority for business
  orlando to gatwick the flight was ok but let down by utterly appalling food the chicken curry was dry and congealed and devoid of any flavour it was mainly just rice the biggest insult was breakfast which was a pretzel filled with cream cheese and a very dry cereal british-airwaysr  not no fruit bits in it  not just like eating sawdust who on earth though that a cream cheese pretzel was an acceptable breakfast bizarre and ridiculous looking around the cabin very few were eaten i commented to the stewardess that it was not a breakfast dish and she replied that it did not look at all appetising come on guys  not even a bread role and jam  be acceptable but cream cheese in a pretzel what planet are you on
 i really enjoyed my flight from london to johannesburg the aircraft was very comfortable and the crew were friendly and polite in inflight entertainment had a wide selection the food was ok but nothing to  excited about i did eat all of it though as i have grown older i have found long haul flights less tolerable so i was not really looking forward to this flight however i was very pleasantly surprised and will definitely use british-airways on that route again
  chicago to hyderabritish-airwaysd via london heathrow all flights left on time but the hyd notlhr  arrived an hour late i literally had to run to find my way through heathrow to to board my connection as for the ba flights i found the cabin staff to be polite and friendly and the food to be decent served on china plates covered with napkins since i was awake most of the time flight attendants checked multiple times outside of meal hours if they could  me anything my only issue with meals is on the hyd notlhr leg lunch was served very late it was almost 8 not9 hours between breakfast & lunch that kind of seems their standard practice: they serve food sometime after take notoff and before landing toilets were maintained well in all 3 flights however i was not impressed by the seats in ba flights i found them to be a bit narrow and not comfortable enough to sleep in because i also could not rest my neck flat down which i could in the aa flight from lhr  not> philadelphia i also think it was a bit difficult for folks in window seats to move out by crossing over the passengers in isle seats if they were old or not agile enough the aa flight from lhr  not> philadelphia had bose noise canceling headphs while the ba flights had just regular s no big deal but still
 san francisco to hyderabritish-airwaysd via london i had a really british-airwaysd experience with british-airways i had been planning for the trip whole year and wanted to try british-airways instead of taking my regular emirates the flight got cancelled just couple of hours before the take notoff the customer care was unresponsive i have waited in the customer care call queue for hours and hours for multiple times i had to go book emirates in the last moment with $400 hike in price i wrote email to customer care it has taken so much time to  a response from them the british-airwaysd part is they wont refund your ticket price i hope no  goes through such similar issue my hst opinion: be sure of your travel plans before you book british-airways i was my first and last journey i wont recommend personally to any
  london to duesseldorf on 21 january flew with them 10 times over a  month period this was the last of those flights 8 of the 10 flights were changed or cancelled the flight i was booked in for this day was cancelled again shortly before departure mayhem at the t5 customer service desk far too few people to serve seats on ba are terrible everything costs extra there is nothing good about ba anymore 
 i had booked business class with my friend as this particular trip was planned to mark a significant milest in my life my 50th birthday on this occasion i had invested in an upgrade and as such i expected nothing less for 15 hours on an overnight flight i had to sit in economy whilst my colleague was in business class i was downgraded as ba overbook their flight by 10% their offer of compensation was £200 i am also waiting almost  month later for a refund in the difference in price between economy and business class this experience has caused undue stress and at this point i am reluctant to use their services in the future their dismissive response completely contradicts their consumer promise and values: “meeting the rising expectations of our customers remains central to our strategy of transforming british-airways into the world's leading globritish-airwaysl premium airline our investment in our staff our fleet and our facilities are all about making sure we provide the very best in customer service” the experience with ba has resulted in a negative end to what was a bucket list holiday i feel i have a duty of care to other consumers to share my experience
 flew london to bengaluru british-airways have reached a new low flight boarded on time but twenty minutes before departure the pilot announced that take off  be delayed as luggage was still to be loaded and engineers were working to replace a pin two hours twenty minutes later flight was finally airborne cabin staff throughout the the flight were unpleasant and unhelpful the ba premium is product nowhere near as good as other operators economy offering the promised fine china dining experience only relates to main course all other food and drink was served in plastic the entire meal came on a cluttered tray dumped on to tray tables with no finesse whatsoever the chick pea starter was icy cold the main course lamb over cooked tasteless and inedible dessert and cheese portions were minuscule entertainment screen was marbled and very small reformatting films to fit to near postage stamp proportions made viewing impossible breakfast service made no pretence to premium service served on plastic and to be eaten with plastic cutlery a very unpleasant experience i have no wish to repeat but sadly i have to return to heathrow in the same way
 we flew british-airways 194 and ba 197 into/out of heathrow late jan 2018 seats 27f/h and 30f/h respectively seats were comfortable but the electronic boxes took up some of the legroom food was ok this is coach so no really high expectations plane was clean flight attendants were friendly the ife worked flawlessly good selection of programs bathrooms were maintained clean throughout entire flight we had beverage runs about every 15 hrs if you wanted anything else snacks were available in galley ba did a good job
  reykjavik to london i had to pay £8 to change seats at check notin £80 for  checked notin british-airwaysggage you also have to pay for food and beverages on board the aircraft all those petty things are why we avoid low cost companies but now that we know those are traits shared with ba we will also avoid ba in the future
  bangkok to lisbon via heathrow we booked our flight tickets directly on ba site since july 2017 for the travelling date of december 24 2017 one day before our travel we processed the online check notin and were surprised to find out that our names have been removed from our first leg of the flight bkk > lhr without prior notice through any communication channels email sms text by ba after many attempts to find a solution it unfortunately turned out that we could not contact any representative office in thailand however we managed to talk to the customer services team in uk she informed us that due to the connecting flight from lhr to lis was cancelled by ba the airline had removed our names from the entire trip 2 sectors the assistant informed us that it was possible for our names to be added british-airwaysck to the bkk > lhr flight if we by ourselves could find a connecting flight from lhr to lis the only solution is either this as explain or to accept a refund of our tickets unfortunately there were no flight available on that day and that left us with only  choice  not to accept the refund to our tickets without offering any other help our intention is to seek for proper explanation from ba in regards to how is it possible that there is no official communication/notification in regards to the flight being canceled to the passengers we had to figure out the situation ourselves after an attempt to check notin online 24 hours before the flight if we had went to check notin counter directly on our departure date we  be without a solution and our whole trip might be cancelled  we were in a roller coaster of emotions over the issue since we had less than 24 hours to find alternative solution from a problem that was not caused by us but ba's neglect in providing proper communication to the passengers finally we left no choice but to book last minute tickets from another airline which we had to pay 66% extra since it was a last minute ticket on christmas eve i find it inexcusable for a world notclass airline to neglect last minute communication to guests on  of the most important day & holiday of the entire year this event had caused us not only an extra charge in our entire trip's spending but left us with  of the worst flying experiences we chose british-airways in hopes of a seamless and stress notfree travel experience but was given no notifications or any alternative help
  johannesburg to cape town a really british-airwayssic flight operated by comair no inflight entertainment you had a usb plug to charge your ph they served breakfast  not it was early in the morning overall a flight with no problems the ground and air staff was good

  gatwick to tobritish-airwaysgo many years since i've flown in ba club class interested to see if all the british-airwaysd reviews are justified outbound flight to tobritish-airwaysgo on 1 january was delayed 2 hours because cleaners had not turned up floor around seat not vacuumed properly looked for flight attendant to see if my jacket could be hung up fa took jacket from me and stuffed it into overhead locker invited over pa system to read high life magazine  not not in seat pocket  not had to ask pre notflight drinks served ok when asked for meal choice options did not correspond with what was on menu asked fa if i had wrong menu fa insisted it was right menu looked again and fa said it was wrong menu and brought correct  meal ok: fillet of beef took a bit of sawing but tasty seat was comfortable if snug ying/yang seat layout makes it hard for fas to see if you have empty cups etc to clear away on your meal tray unless you're in an aisle seat meal tray not horizontal did not bother to watch movie as screen quality poor flight had caught up a bit on arrival at antigua for stopover but was delayed a further 4 hours by need to replace faulty oil indicator arrived tobritish-airwaysgo 5 hrs late return overnight flight left tobritish-airwaysgo on time old school fas on board  not attentive capable unobtrusive do not think ba trains them like that any more meal tray came with dessert already on it i had not selected when converted to bed seat is good for length but cramped widthwise so you ca not bend your legs as i do in sleep got a couple of hrs sleep lying on my british-airwaysck seems fairly common for fas on other airlines to come through occasionally during the night asking if you're obviously awake if they can  you anything not on this flight i guess if we want anything you have to  it yourself from the uninspiring club kitchen breakfast ok and flight arrived slightly early i can remember when a flight on ba club class was something to look forward to cabin crew were proud to be work for them and it sh through in the service not so any more british-airwayssed on these 2 flights
 no curtains in business class: once again british-airways is cutting corners and treating its premium customers as if they dont matter this flight had no curtains or separation between business and economy class: passengers from economy helped themselves to the lockers above business class seats and use the forward toilet why pay more to fly business then dreadful flew in from chicago to heathrow a few days ago on first class and the lounge was the smallest ive ever seen and with awful food the controls in my first class seat did not work either british-airways is fast going down the drains avoid
 flew british-airways from warsaw to london heathrow my complaint is about the cabin luggage policy my full notsize cabin british-airwaysg was given a 'yellow tag' and i had to put it under the seat because the aircraft was full if you dont have enough cabin space to accomodate all the cabin british-airwaysgs please introduce the wizz air solution the bigger cabin luggage is charged an extra price or decrease the allowed luggage size the current cabin luggage policy is arbitrary and unfair
  i was due to fly london heathrow to vancouver jan 7th  six hours before my flight was to depart it was cancelled when i called in after waiting for 45 minutes on hold i was told it was due to 'operational requirements' a lot of british-airwaysck and forth but the bottom line ba could not  me british-airwaysck to yvr until thursday i could  a refund on the return portion my flight which leaves me nowhere as there is no reasonably cheap option to re notbook or they could fly me into seattle on tuesday and i must make my way home from there on my own dime and i could submit for reimbursement from ba  not no guarantees they will reimburse though i was told when ba cannot  you to your home destination their policy dictates that they will fly you to the next closest destination only never mind that the destination is in another country and forces me to clear customs there and at home i am flying air canada when i return to the uk in february at least if they cancel my flight they will make a better effort to  me british-airwaysck home
  london heathrow to madrid connecting onto iberia to panama city had some problems before check in and although we had been able to pre book our seats with iberia from the time of booking even though we had paid for business class flights ba still wanted £20 per person each way to pre book our seats we tried to check in on line and were unable to when we arrived at check in we were initially told that even though we had booked through tickets that they could not issue boarding passes for the full journey as there was less than 25 hours turn around time and we  have to collect our british-airwaysggage from re claim and check in again we pointed out that this  certainly cause us to miss the flight and as we were flying to costa rica it was unlikely that there  be a suitable alternate flight that day and we  lose a day of our holiday waiting around in madrid airport this flight had been booked since march 2017 and no  had raised this the assistant rang some and we were eventually issued with the boarding passes and had no problems with flights or luggage we were quite disappointed with the seating in the cabin to madrid the seats were the same as economy but with a metal plate over the middle seat we were offered food and drink and as we had eaten n the lounge we did not want anything but it did look of a high standard we were we felt unnecessarily made anxious at check in and were disappointed by the seating in club world we were disgusted at being asked to pay extra to book specific seats that's just greedy
  london to dusseldorf my suitcase did not arrive i was unable to file a claim upon arrival because ba 940 was delayed and i had to catch a train to osnabrück but was told i could file online that is incorrect because the online system does not accept american airlines strap tag numbers i tried to call the number i was given but the agents in madrid refused to take the claim over the teleph and advised me to file online and after i explained that this was impossible due to the faulty system they told me to call the dus british-airwaysggage office i called the local number they gave me but the call was routed every time british-airwaysck to madrid who again refused to take the claim finally on about my third attempt to reason with the agents i found a young lady who was helpful and took my claim however i did not still see my suitcase until four days later now i am trying with difficulty in just ting reïmbursed for my modest expenses incurred toiletries underwear doctor's consultation and replacement medication on another topic £180 for a tin of coca cola
  johannesburg to london awful pathetic service and staff attitude so nonchalant my seat area was absolutely filthy when i asked the stewardess to assist she looked at me like i was such a nuisance made clicking sounds and picked up some fruit peels nuts and piece of paper  between 3 not4am in the morning i went in search of snacks found the cabin staff in the kitchen area when i asked please may i have some snacks i was told to  it myself from the side counter and the staff continued with their conversation not  them got up to assist not  of them had replaced any of the snacks the counter was empty only about 3 crisps available and 2 chocs they kept serving the person next to me over me instead of going around me did not matter that they blocked my viewing  not that is fine and understandable but no excuse me please can we nothing rudeness at it's best if you asked anything the stewardess made it look like an absolute chore and made  feel like you were being a burden
  london to bangkok i was a bit apprehensive about flying ba club world due to the british-airwaysd reviews the airline has received recently boarding at heathrow was well organised due to their group boarding policy on board i offered a pre champagne or water once airborne choose gin and tonic and cashew nuts meal pre ordered online i found all three courses exceptional and very well cooked the staff worked tireless right through the twelve hour flight i know ba club seats are not ideal but nevertheless they are still more comfortable than any middle east airline i have flown with entertainment screen poor and needs urgent revamp cannot see when lights are on in the cabin very nice to see a mixed aged crew that shows ageism does not exist at ba i also must commend ba for their quick medical response to a passenger who had collapsed on the aircraft in club there rapid response and actions probritish-airwaysbly saved his life i flew on 12 january well d ba you are pulling in the right direction again
 what i have to say “to fly to serve” a very well respected motto british-airways is always a good choice i was flying business class from lgw to fco everything was excellent the crew were really nice for the whole flight i was travelling solo and i had a long conversation with a steward on board while he was serving the food we got a varied and luxury food and beverage choice i got champagne and salmon everything was lly tasty we departed and landed on time with direct connection to terminal with finger in both the airports and i really appreciate this every time so what to say british-airways is always a warranty and is with no doubt  of the best european airlines their success is surely deserved
 san jose ca to london heathrow round nottrip in club world had originally booked in premium economy but received upgrade offers from british-airways that were too go to pass up extremely happy and impressed with level of service provided glass of champagne upon boarding premium whiskies and a nice fillet of steak for dinner cabin crew came by constantly to see how i was doing on both legs lie flat seat gave me 5+ hours of sleep on both flights the seat itself was not as wide as i anticipated and the lie flat bed can feel somewhat claustrophobic but legroom is no issue the 787 not9 is a fantastic aircraft comfortable and quiet fast track passes an added plus flying out of san jose is a bonus since i'm a ten minute drive to home overall very pleased with british-airways and the service provided access to lounges at both airports another plus  no complaints from me will look to fly ba again later this year just hope they have more offers for business class
  dubritish-airwaysi to london cabin looked dire and was not particularly clean seats are dreadful sat by the window and literally had to climb over another person to  to the aisle product must be about 15 years out of date food was of poor quality no mid notflight snacks such as fruit salad or sandwiches  second meal was tiny arrived at a bus gate in london no bus appeared for about 30 minutes crew blamed the bus providing company overall an awful experience i do not intend to repeat 
  london to düsseldorf return outbound flight from londiin city was fine boarding was quick and smooth flight was not too busy nice crew on time departure and a breakfast tray which i did not expect on the flight british-airwaysck a319 to heathrow and you need to buy on board do not understand the concept of ba it's an incosistent product as on the outbound flight there was service on the inbound flight no service they should decide if they are a full notservice airline or low cost i understand that they are under pressure but they are usually more expensive than lufthansa  and a completely different story if compared to easyjet easyjet is not offering any great service but you  not expect it with ba prices are like full notservice but value for my is much worse than easyjet or eurowings
  new york to london my flight was cancelled on november 17th the day i was supposed to fly in the evening i received text when i was in middle of doing important last minute arrangements that i had to leave in middle after talking to  of the agents for hour and a half i was able to  alternative flight that was leaving from charlotte instead of new york in order to  this new flight i had to be at jfk airport at 1:45 pm to make this happen i had to skip all last minute arrangements the flight from charlotte means more commuting and more discomfort because it was not direct flight to london our 7 hours flight turned into 12 hours on top of longer and uncomfortable commuting i was unable to sit with my children the meal i requested was not available on the new flight absolute worst experience while flying british-airwaysck from london to new york on november 27th we got the flight as scheduled but the crew didnt have our requested meal available it was my first experience with british-airways and ill make sure its the last  on my flight british-airwaysck to new york i requested water to  of the attendants and she didnt turn british-airwaysck for 9 minutes i reminded her she said she has been very busy no apology no courtesy nothing a big name like british-airways has such a poor service with such rude and unprofessional staff
 flew british-airways from bangkok to aberdeen via heathrow no complaints flight a little delayed on the return leg but all notin notall was good ba and the rest of the european airlines cant quite keep up with the middle eastern airlines in terms of aircraft emirates etihad etc always seem to have the latest models but the service food check notin luggage allowance etc was all good too many people put ba down but thats just the british way  not we should  behind out national carrier
 flew british-airways from rotterdam to london city our trip started with a delay due to a technical problem but we were promptly rebooked on the next flight which took off a little over an hour later so that was not a big problem nice aircraft with good legroom and a friendly crew providing a drink and a snack on this 40min flight inbound flight had a delay of 45 mins again because an other plane had a technical problem so on that point ba needs to improve also check in via ba notapp did not work both ways so again there's room for improvement would still recommend especially on this route because of the short check notin times and short walkways at rotterdam and london city price can be high though especially when you have checked luggage but we had not and i booked well in advance paid 200 euros rtn for two which was fine the advantage of london city is apart from the distance to london that you do not have to pay for an expensive train ride
 flew british-airways from london to cape town where to start yesterday 6th january our flight had been rescheduled from 1830 for 11am today due to technical problems which they could not fix that night after a fair amount of announcements it was decided we  be put up at the hilton hotel next door so we all had to go british-airwaysck to immigration and then collect our luggage and schlep to the ba desk to collect our vouchers we duly went along to the hilton hotel and waited in line to eventually be told there were no more rooms available to the rest of us  not by now it was 10pm so we were tired and feeling a little strained especially those with small children the desk staff told us they were trying to ph ba to ask what to do with the rest of us but were ting no answer from them so at this stage my husbritish-airwaysnd and i decided to come home and got a very expensive taxi british-airwaysck to london safe in the knowledge that our flight has been rescheduled for 11am on the 7th january we duly left home this morning at 8am to  here in time for our 11am flight only to be met with the knowledge that our flight has been rescheduled for 1830 tonight oh dear ba why could not you let us all know this by sending an email with a ph number to drop into our inboxes sometime during the night just too efficient for you i guess so we've been kindly issued with vouchers to cover breakfast which they didnt do no problem ba we did not mind forking out another £5 to cover it you used to be such a wonderful airline flying our country's colours proudly and we were proud of you it's almost laughable at the errors you have committed to your paying customers
 the first class cabins are in need of refurbishment but since this aircraft type is ageing this might been a pointless wish the seats were very comfortable and completely functional entertainment choices were current varied and easy to access although the earph supplied were not of the noise cancelling variety the cabin staff was remarkably efficient and very kind the food for dinner while not overgenerous in choice was delicious and well presented with the option of dining at your own convenience the breakfast menu was surprising in the variety of choices offered overall an extremely pleasant experience there is no wi notfi available on this aircraft type
  toronto to london return – business to london and first british-airwaysck to toronto all on avios fast check in at pearson with the usual friendly check in team fast track was quick and in the new 3rd party lounge within 15 mins ba presumably to save my have shut their lounge and g to a 3rd party provider – premium plaza its frankly awful no class or professionalism with limited wine and spirits options and cheap and nasty food piled high elevator music drove us mad and we were pleased to leave the lounge prematurely to board the aircraft  not what on earth are you thinking ba fast boarding though with fewer crew the boarding service in club is fragmented late with champagne wash british-airwaysg after take off etc with only four crew working club there just isnt time to offer a quality pre flight experience the new tray service for drinks is more professional but took ages we were served drinks 80 minutes into the flight and as we were near the british-airwaysck of the cabin had our meal 10 mins after being served drinks all choices were available but the food is just not club standard poor entrees cheap salads and reminiscent of economy food of 15 years ago ba really need to roll out the new meal service quickly – how long does the new pilot service to new york have to last for got some sleep had an okay fast breakfast passed on the vile looking egg and british-airwayscon muffin with an early arrival and british-airwaysgs topping off a better than expected flight returning on first was  of my better experiences via the new first check in fast track and concorde lounge excellent service on boarding a fast drinks service after take off and some really well cooked food –all choices available some decent sleep was followed by a really average afternoon tea dry sandwiches with mean fillings but okay cakes and scs early arrival at the gate was spoilt by very slow british-airwaysgs 45 mins after landing these were my first mixed fleet biz and first class service experiences the crew were young and lacking experience / knowledge but make an enthusiastic polite and smart however they were clearly following the book to the letter which leads to slower and wooden service long haul crew were cranky at times but they  connect better and offer a more sleek / fast service which is what is needed on east coast flights flowers have returned to the first class british-airwaysthrooms and the slide in quality and cuts in service seemed to have stopped but ba really need to roll out the promised changes faster to retain premium customers
  las vegas to manchester via london fairly dire as always ba is cutting the new club world product as i speak before even having rolled it out addicted to cuts perfect partner for aa so i  on board and am told i now need to purchase food and beverages on the domestic leg so why did i not fly a low cost airline there no difference whatsoever the crew seemed fresh out of school and so inexperienced and what do you  for food on a transatlantic 10 hour flight to vegas a starter of lettuce and carrot and two unripe cherry tomatoes no oil just some grey vinegar it was foul i assume nobody ate it the main was tomato pasta or curry the curry was so appalling i ate n of it the chicken was like paste the sauce dried out and the rice overcooked i cannot bear fruit so the only normal looking thing a mini blueberry muffin was given to my ravenous neighbour no cheese crackers these days nothing served with cold tea i really loved also being rammed on a transfer bus from t3 to lhr t5 having waited 30 minutes to  on bus sweating like crazy the driver just kept shouting to move down the bus it wo not leave until it is full then the busses onto the british-airwaysck of the plane even though the bridge is on and to top it all of ba now offers a free copy of the sun instead of the mail or express i have another flight in may which is non notrefundable i am desperately hoping they move my flight so i can cancel they usually do this 2 or 3 times a booking so feeling good this is not a full service airline it is fully no frills the only exception is i think is the long haul canteen meal you  the airline is a national embritish-airwaysrrassment the flight attendants try and have to cope with what they have been given but the ground staff are beyond it fly this bud airline at your own peril think about spending a bit more i'm going to try lufthansa or thomas cook though i admit i'm dreading that prospect
  london to dubritish-airwaysi  this was a terrible flight with grubby cabins same old menu but worse still people from economy taking the seats in business without upgrade or paying the staff were indifferent on complaints and eventually led to removing them after abusive language if ba actually knew their premium passengers they  have avoided this
  amsterdam to london service ryanair  not tolerate but with premium prices every two years or so i fly with ba and every two years i am reminded just why i do not normally fly with them whilst not as british-airwaysd as my previous experience which chopped about 12 hours off a 2 day break to milan and left me £££ out of pocket as all public transport had stopped by the time we arrived an no they  not refund me we were still delayed all the other airlines had their delays on the board so their customers could do other things ba did not show the delay until we should have been boarding get to the gate with my shopping what else are you to do during a delay and am told that it must fit in my suitcase or they'll put  of my british-airwaysgs in the hold even ryanair allows a british-airwaysg of duty free on it  obviously have fit under the seat next to my purse but no~ that was not allowed once we were on board the reason became clear just like easyjet ryanair and many of the other bud airlines ba does not include a checked british-airwaysg meaning that all the hand luggage wo not fit in the cabin ergo their staff find silly reasons to confiscate your british-airwaysg so not only was the flight delayed but i now had to wait for a suitcase once we arrived at gatwick everything went smoothly i managed to catch the last train to my destination unlike the previous time i'd flown with them additionally the staff were very rude and condescending towards passengers do not fly ba save your my and go with a bud airline the colours may be gaudier but the service is the same and the staff are infinitely friendlier
  london to johannesburg i was pleasantly surprised at how good the flight was from lhr notjnb i booked this flight as it was a direct flight and although it was around £130 more than emirates and qatar airways it saved around 10 hours off of the journey the a380 seats were reasonably comfortable and i had plenty of leg room the cabin crew were professional and prompt when requested inflight entertainment was ok with a good selection of movies they do need updating though as some were released early 2017 lack of onboard wifi is a big letdown too food was standard airline food neither good or british-airwaysd but ok ba has been taken over for air travel by the big middle eastern airlines but this flight was good and  have no problem flying them again  not long haul only
  will never fly with ba again outbound flight the economy toilet was broken so economy passengers used business class loos our seats in business class were also broken and food was late as  of the ovens was broken cabin crew said the aircraft should not have been in service i agree flight home was cancelled by text at 530pm day before return no assistance provided by ba told it was not there problem and sort my own accommodation out took nearly 2 hours hanging on the ph before any  reluctantly agree to rebook me onto another flight was told club seats were not available on the only flight with seats departing within 7 days so reluctantly accepted economy seats was told i could not have a refund of the difference between club and economy looked at ba site later that day and club seats were available on the flight they had re notbooked me onto called british-airwaysck but they refused to put me in the cabin i had paid for saying i had volunteered to downgrade and i  have to pay to upgrade £600 each plus pay an admin fee to upgrade to a service they were trying to charge me twice for ba is now as british-airwaysd as ryanair so will never fly with them again they're charging premium prices for sub standard bucket class service
  london to tel aviv  i have been waiting on my luggage for five days during my trip thanks to the incompetence of british-airways i landed in tel aviv and waited  hour for my british-airwaysg to appear and when it didnt i went to the qas counter and gave them my information for three days my british-airwaysg was in london before reaching tel aviv and then the driver didnt bring my british-airwaysg to where i was staying
 i flew premium economy from london to cape town on british-airways having flown premium economy before i had certain expectations of what i  be ting but i was sorely disappointed  not this was by far the most expensive premium economy i have ever flown and unfortunately also by far the worst the plane was old and tired and clearly in need of some refurbishment from premium economy i expected wider seats and more legroom  not the seats were cramped and the remote for the entertainment system was located in the side of the seat where i was constantly pushing against it i finally gave up and hung the remote control over the side of the seat the personal entertainment system with noise notreducing headphs  not the screen was tiny the blind next to me could not be pulled down the headphs were plugged into the side of the seat where i kept knocking them but the quality was inferior to the point that i spent the flight having to hold the headphs plugged in so that i could actually hear anything expected to board ahead of economy passengers with priority boarding  not no priority boarding at all i find it shocking that ba charges exorbitant prices to fly planes that quite clearly are on their last legs i needed to change my return flight after having tried several times with no success i phd ba and was on hold for about 15 minutes after which i gave up and just cancelled the flight which worked first time i booked a flight on another airline and for just £200 more i got a seat in business class that was absolutely brilliant
  hong kong to london before christmas in first class boarding was a little chaotic there was no priority for first class passengers maybe the flight was fully booked cabin crew was very attentive and efficient service was excellent ba does not have the best first class product but their staff is the best in europe food was tasteful and wine selection was superb i had very good 9 hours sleep before landing punctually at lhr looking forward to flying with them again in january
  dublin to heathrow ba s worse and worse and worse today was special though as usual the did the standard in dublin by calling the flight as boarding in the lounge when it clearly wasnt  not after a five minute walk from the lounge it still hadnt started again as usual club food is the choice between a petrol station quality panini and a minute salad today as a special treat they hadnt heated the paninis for my row  not so cold they really showed the nasty cheap ingredients and finally they ran out of champagne not about the only advantage left of club 
  london to new york aircraft was very dated ife poor meal service average no snacks poor drinks service crew exceedingly unfriendly and customer service after the flight abysmal seats on these aircraft which have not been refreshed are beyond threadbritish-airwaysre and were outdated a decade ago the meal service has taken a severe cut in recent years to top everything off the crew couldnt even provide a sincere smile or feign the slightest interest  not embritish-airwaysrrassing when you tell ba about a negative experience theyll waffle on about how great they are but fail to resolve the complaint  not absolute waste of time  not dont waste your my flying ba  not ive had far more positive experiences on ryanair
  new york to london ife was good and the meal wasnt british-airwaysd drinks were served throughout the flight before we landed crisps and a chocolate were handed out on the return trip when we arrived at jfk the queues were terrible after we got through the queues the gate staff announced the plane  be delayed by  hour due to a  technical fault return flight was enjoyable but the plane was very outdated and ife screens were tiny 
  budapest to philadelphia via london they changed my return flight by more than 4 hours when i asked them to change british-airwaysck to a similar time they refused even when a flight was there called british-airwaysck and got another agent who did it but changed business class to economy then they refuse me access to the business lounge and also refuse to refund the difference between the two classes wonder what they do with the miles the worst business class i have flown never buy their premium class lounge in london is worse than the free lounge an american express card provides what the heck is wrong with them
 london heathrow to hong kong on the a380 a couple of weeks ago i flew in premium economy which was obtained through points the seats were comfy and felt quite spacious however i am quite a small person glasses of champagne/wine offered on arrival and the food was quite good the attendants were polite inflight entertainment was decent i especially liked the festive season section which had a variety of holiday/christmas movies plane left and arrived on time having had several negative experiences with british-airways in the past i was pleasantly surprised with this flight
  london to montreal very british-airwaysd service with delayed luggage for some reason the person at london heathrow send my suitcase under some else's name and to a different destination i was flying from london to montreal and my suitcase was sent to dublin first guy i talked on the ph after a week of no news at all he told me that the suitcase was found but was left there at the airport and no further action was taken were they waiting for me to ask them to send it or something in theory he sent an email asking the airport to send my suitcase to montreal but after another week of no further news and website still saying suitcase is missing i decided to call them again to find out that my suitcase was still in dublin a second email was sent to  my suitcase send it to me a couple of days after and of course with no news at all from them i decided to call them british-airwaysck again this time my suitcase was not in dublin it was sent to london heathrow and they lost it again at that airport this guy asked me to call them british-airwaysck monday morning london time so i did i called british-airwaysck again on monday morning and after being about 10 minutes waiting for the guy to connect to his london team he asked me to go to the website to add description of the items in my suitcase when i had d that same day i placed the delayed luggage report do not they have all this info in file after telling him that i did that first day he then asked me to call them british-airwaysck in 48h again i'm tired of going behind them like if it was my fault they lost my suitcase no compensation was mentid to me even that i had to buy clothes and some other items that i already had in my suitcase lucky enough this happened in my final destination and at the end of my trip otherwise they  make my vacation quiet miserable i understand there is a huge number of suitcases traveling around everyday but that's no reason to let you wondering and waiting forever to  what's yours i think this whole experience  have been much more satisfying if they showed some empathy and instead of making me wait and call them all the time i  have  a call or email from them every once in a while following up with me after this awful experience with their missing luggage department i hardly doubt i will use british-airways again
  london to houston executive gold club refused to help me or keep us informed about the case that did not  put on to the flight they subsequently missed another two days of flights at 6 possible flights per day the staff were steadfastly of the opinion that this is not problem because we have received a card with 801 usd to buy essential items and that is sufficient in their eyes furthermore they were more interested in leaving to go home and had ticked all the boxes at their end needless to say that because we are away for christmas & new year we cannot wear the british-airwayssics for dinner another fact that really made no impact nor was it of any consequence to gold club team i repeatedly explained that we could not attend dinner without the proper attire which is currently residing in the case that ba and british-airwaysggage handlers have deemed less than priority because we have been given 801 usd no ph calls can be made to update us and the website advises that they are currently looking for the luggage which  be the same case that was dismissed from being loaded onto today's flight furthermore the suitcase could go on a minimum of 6 flights per day including the actual day it was not sent as there was a later flight which  have reunited the british-airwaysg with the owner & negated the requirement of giving us 801 usd in the first place the callous disregard and blatant contempt displayed throughout this ordeal has ruined our holiday to the extent that we have requested ba return us home where we can collect the suitcase ourselves the tag that may have fallen off is of no concern as every is well aware the shell of the case has the british-airwaysr code stickers on it for that exact reason so that you can track the items 
  las vegas to london absolutely horrendous experience we were board and then left to sit on the plane for over 2 hours in high temperatures with no air conditioning  not the passengers were all sweating before the plane took off kept saying it  be 10 mins and then 15 mins 2 hours odd later we finally took off economy on ba is horrible seats are uncomfortable no space can hardly  refreshments the cabin crew were offering us warm tap water food is british-airwaysd to make it worse when we landed in london we had to sit on the plane for a further 30 mins because ba did not have a spare arrivals gate due to all the delays we had to run like mad people to  from heathrow to gatwick in time for our onward flight with ba against all odds we got their with 30 mins to spare plane had not boarded yet but they casually said we were too late and said we'd have to fly the next day absolute joke i wo not be flying with ba again when i have a choice
 flew british-airways from dubritish-airwaysi to london heathrow overnight flight that departed on time and arrived 25 minutes early to a very easy to navigate through t5 unfortunately this was the only positive aspect of my flight flight was on board a very old 744 with very poor inflight entertainment b747 are beautiful old planes but the interiors should be updated the food was ok the biggest disappointment was the cabin crew who all seemed miserable and not interested no smiles or even a welcome on board whilst walking down the aisle on arrival they were standing toher talking and laughing and not even acknowledging any of the passengers the service provided by ba has significantly declined over the past few years even the newer planes b777 and b787 have not got cabins that compete with todays market also just like other bud airlines you now have to pay to choose your seat very very disappointed that i did not choose another carrier as there are loads to choose from on this route roughly for the same price
 i was on a flight from new york jfk  not budapest via london heathrow on 9th december the flight was delayed 6hrs when i arrived to london i got information that my flight to budapest was cancelled due to heavy snow that was on the 10th december i was there with a few thousends other passengers from ba nobody gave us any food any water and the most important any information as to what we should do with our transfers flight and suitcase after waiting 2 not3 hrs for my suitcase i was struggling with cold at terminal 4 someon from ba took us to terminal 5 today is 12th december and i am still in london without any information about my british-airwaysggage and transfer flight to budapest i paid myself for a  hotel and taxi because all other hotels ba offered are fully booked this is not what you normally expect from british national carrier airlines very poor website nothing is working and for 3 days no call centre they try to tranfer you from  number to another without any sense
 flew tokyo narita to london heathrow with british-airways flight delayed by four hours  not which is understandable due to the weather in the uk at the time the inflight entertainment was awful it was good for only a short haul journey very limited selection and very dated equipment/screens plus they kept stalling the staff were ok although a few seemed allergic to smiling and seemed glum we were fed at the beginning of the journey and then not until an hour towards the end the food was average and i was very hungry throughout the service as far as i am aware on a long haul flight especially the services are to help you feel as comfortable as possible  not i dont call being starved very comfortable other airlines offer snacks throughout the journey why cant you you used to be the best and now youre bud i wont be flying with british-airways again 
 i was quite disappointed with my experience with british-airways first of all our flight was two hours late which made me miss my connecting flight in lhr however the crew on the ground handled the situation quite well and provided all passengers with food notvouchers and even the captain came out of the plane to explain the situation however there was no information on connecting flights in lhr once on the plane the lack of free service during the flight was a big minus as it now really does not make a big difference if you are flying ryanair or british-airways seats were okay but nothing outstanding  not same with the crew
 flew british-airways to pisa due to flight times and ba miles overall a poor economy class product the seats were really tight staff were ok but seemed stressed you had to pay for food in economy which is new norm of ba and they predict other airlines will follow suit difficult to  a glass of water three requests and then it materialised and that too for a young child at check notin their automated system failed so it was d manually  not thank goodness for carbon units still employed by ba overall ba is dramatically failing those who have ba miles will exhaust them and shift to other airlines ba is no longer uk's national airline the magic of alex cruz and willie walsh is not working if it ever did avoid if you are paying up front rfor your tickets loyalty does not pay
  london to toulouse british-airways is no longer a full service airline to compete with easyjet and ryan air it has removed food and drink from economy class and replaced with m&s food this is over notpriced and not that great secondly the food was never complementary not it was included in your ticket price this was the case in this flight to toulouse next time go to pret and  a meal from there and carry it on board i asked for a glass of water this came in the last 30 minutes of the flight once the trolley had g down the aisle at least offer people water  not it is a human right the seats too are tight and a rear toilet in economy has been removed to maximise profits in this flight there was no spare tissue or toilet roll  i was told by the cabin crew when i asked about the new service level that more may be in store for ba's comers  not charging for food in economy class for long haul flights i hope that this is not true the only saving grace is a comprehensive network and flight times are good customer care and service has g avoid ba if you can consume your ba miles and shift to other full service carriers they are better and more responsive
 great flight out from london to santiago lovely friendly crew goats cheese salad to start fish pie for main good selection of wines and managed 7 hrs sleep on way out and even longer coming british-airwaysck 787 not900 is a fantastic aircraft even if you do have to climb over some feet to  out the window seats are very private flying this aircraft to seychelles in may and really looking forward to it just waiting to try the new bedding now and catering just flown out to kul and ba are way ahead of mh
  london to rome it's been a while since i last flew on ba and it certainly has changed while the terminal staff aircraft and seats are of the same high standards as before  not the free in notflight meals and beverages have disappeared and must now be purchased it seems that ba is slowly morphing into a low notcost carrier at least as far as european destinations are concerned presumably this is due to the competition from easyjet and ryanair as well as it's ceo hailing from vueling i suppose it's only fair given that the fare was as cheap as the other two and ba flies out of lhr
  london to manchester hard to complain about a flight which last 35 mins but i was hoping for a british-airwayscon sandwich to keep me going after coming off a long haul flight with a short connection this flight used to include complimentary tea/british-airwayscon sandwich until the much criticized move to m&s inflight offerings and a hot sandwich is not available anymore all things considered that is understandable
  london to seattle a seamless flight which was on time and little to complain about efficient and professional service meal service fine good comfort and additional space in premium economy worth the extra ife selection was perhaps a little limited bags slow to arrive at seattle but do not put that on ba
  seattle to london good experience all round and nothing much to complain about fa's efficient and friendly flight was on time meal quality was average overall believe the extra amount for premium economy worthwhile although i had cashed in some miles to cover the upgrade so perhaps a false economy major complaint is ba's policy of charging to book a seat  not it's extremely irritating and stressful especially in premium economy upwards
  london to barcelona the ground service was really poor even thought i used premium counter sapphire status of ow  i paid 22 pounds to  exit for myself and my mom however the staff in the counter keep question if my mom can speak english staff could not distinguish the taiwan passport from the china passport and keep said that we need visa to go to spain it took nearly 10 min for her to confirm with her manager and her attitude was really really british-airwaysd the worst staff i had  met although ba sold a very expensive ticket however even a cup of water you have to pay for it i  never choose this airline again
  vancouver to edinburgh via london was the worst travel experience i have had i was travelling with 2 seniors +85 & +70 we requested assistance and nobody showed up at any of the gates neither departing nor arriving we actually had to beg for help the distance between gates is far and too much walking for seniors in our way from london to edinburgh it was a nightmare the flight was delayed and we got to london about an hour late on top of that we asked for assistance to take the 2 seniors to the next gate and no  seemed to care the 2 seniors had to walk all that way it was not only the walking it was the rush they had as we had to go trough immigration and the next flight was living in less than 1:30 hours on our way british-airwaysck from inverness to canada another nightmare despite we requested assistance in advance once again there was nobody waiting for the seniors at the gate again we had to beg for assistance and the british-airways staff did not seem to know or care about this they said that they called the buggy and that was all we said that we were going to miss the airplane as the gates/ terminal distance were far and no  seemed to care at all we were lucky i asked a gentleman who was driving  of the buggy and passed by and he kindly accept to take the seniors to take the bus area from terminal 5 to 3 in london and then arranged for them to be picked up in terminal 3 and after security point this gentleman who is not british-airways employee provided a great service summarizing the only good experience we had was with an external person that just by chance i asked and he decided to help us out seats were another problem we did the online check in 24 before and we had the seats already chosen 12d for  senior isle and 18d isle for the other senior when we got to the counter in inverness airport the agent told us there were not seat chose even though we had prove and the boarding who was sent by email showing the seats then the agent put the seniors almost at the end of the airplane and in the middle seats so once again more walking for them problems to  in/out the seats and of course problem to  to the washroom  not luggage another problem british-airways in inverness said that the luggage goes directly to victoria and that we did not have to pick it up in vancouver surprise surprise we went through customs and when we got to westjet counter for the connection to victoria they asked for the luggage  they said we had to pick it up before going through customs there was no way to go british-airwaysck to the carousel so we had to wait for the westjet staff to contact somebody from british-airways to  us to the carrusel and take the luggage so nightmare again and another rush to us to  to the next fligh according to westhet agents they said that british airways should have had the assistance for the seniors and of course pick the luggage with them and bring it to the connection what can you expect from british-airways if it doesnt even care about the passengers that are seniors and requested assistance we can only thank westjet staff who provide the assistance in vancouver
 london to berlin tegel return it's becoming ever more difficult to notice any difference between british-airways and the bud airlines the only saving grace is that i've never experienced any issues flying out of or into t5 noticeable cost cutting measures include the removal of complimentary onboard food and drink but also ba have removed a toilet in economy within their a319 fleet to make space for seats in row 24 and 25 meaning there is only  economy toilet disgraceful my flight to berlin was busy and the line for the sole toilet existed throughout the duration of the flight meaning the flight attendants could not offer an efficient trolley service and involved a continual display of other passengers weaving in and out of aisle seats i feel for the staff who often work tirelessly 
 flew london heathrow to dubritish-airwaysi arrived at the new wing at t5 a quick process and into the concorde lounge i noticed as before the check in staff do not mention the concorde lounge per se just straight through there sir and into the 1st class lounge this option was rammed am pleased to confirm that the concorde lounge has had a long overdue make notover it looks a bit better had a snack and a few glasses of fizz  not then made my way to terminal b friendly fa showed me and wife to our seats looked freshly cleaned pushed british-airwaysck on time 1st class was full airborne i had dinner: mezze to start which was nice some chicken thingy for mains  not which was horrible cheese and biscuits to conclude wines were ok the seat the new first  not is not wearing well looking somewhat tired managed to  some sleep on the bed with the usual duvet and blankets i am a tall guy and need the space the club world option is horrendous very pleased to confirm that mr alex cruz bas ceo has re notintroduced flowers in the 1st wc readers will recall he cancelled these last year to save costs if mr cruz wants to save costs he should  rid of the gas guzzlers 747 not400s so a full 1st cabin will generate about £40000 of revenue the flowers for 2 wcs probritish-airwaysbly cost £800  not so pleased to see the airline is still flying and not g british-airwaysnkrupt over the re notintroduction of eight quids worth of flowers per flight the 1st product is very mediocre compared with say emirates some have said its sort of an upmarket business class i'd agree with that one  think ba  want to make a big impression on this route  not with at least some high end food logic is not something ba seem to understand  not given the high level of negative reviews on this site very disappointing
 flew british-airways from dubritish-airwaysi to london heathrow arrived at dubritish-airwaysi airport checked in  not and endured horrendous security not bas fault walked miles to the new lounge it's a weird set up you walk through the club option with a considerable variation of food  not to a tiny room with small options of food seating very mediocre made our way to the plane departed british-airwaysng on time airbourne i went for lunch straight away  not after a couple of g&ts arabic lamb starter boring and tasteless no other options skipped the soup had a salad the beef mains was very good  not not exceptional and no wow factor just nice red wine was ok  not mid priced stuff at about £25 a bottle my wife was told the beef was now unavailable my friend had beef and so did i  not when challenged on this i was told  not only 3 beefs aboard this flight was again full and had been for weeks 14 people 3 beefs a joke my wife had an arab dish which she did not like when it came to coffee my friend then i  not had a choice of chocolates my wife then had the box offered  not only to have it more or less demanded british-airwaysck by a pushy fa most ba cabin staff are good  not this  was a pr disaster flight was smooth all the way home another sad experience from our national carrier definitely not worth some of the extreme prices posted for this route
 flew british-airways from saint lucia to london gatwick agree with other recent reviews: ba quality is severely lacking compared to other oneworld carriers business class we were not addressed by name staff seemed rushed and not proactive at all: had to ask for anything we required not all breakfast items were available seat space and comfort seriously under par nobody came to collect rubbish prior to landing so it remained on the floor in front of me did not feel like valued customers
 flew from london heathrow to belfast george best airport on ba1414 boarding was well controlled and the breakfast food served onboard was very good i was also impressed by the fast and efficient service arrived in belfast ahead of schedule time overall very good flight and service
  london to miami british-airways have been so disappointing and need to improve fast they cancelled a flight the morning of a flight and so i had to buy a new flight the compensation they offered  was £22 then my most recent trip was to miami which i had an expired esta but instead of letting me know they could put me on flight for a small fee they let me buy a £1000 new flight then offered me a £112 refund when i phd to complain i am a ba member and must say the customer service is atrocious as a company its just spiralling down
 flew london heathrow to new york jfk have flown this route a number of times with british-airways but this was my first experience with the new club world offerings white company bedding improved catering refurbished 747 club world cabin the new improvements are excellent particularly the catering both the presentation and the taste of the new food is a significant step above the previous club world catering offering and the new ‘pick your starter and desert options from the display trolley is a real nice touch the new bedding makes the club world bed much more comfortable to sleep on
 berlin to london city i have never experienced such an unreliable unprofessional airline that is so hard to contact my flight kept being delayed for hours after more than 4 hours delay there was no point for me to fly to london anymore as i had missed an important meeting i was told that i will  my flight price refunded and also  a compensation after a few days i call their customer support to ask about the refund they told me that i will  the refund within 7 days after 4 weeks i notice that they still have not refunded me it's very difficult to contact them the ph hotline is only available until 5pm monday notfriday they hide the contact form somewhere deep in their website once i managed to send them a message i only  a reply a few days later telling me that they ca not reply to this case via email and that i should call all i want at this point is to  my deserved flight price refund i take an hour off my work to be able to call in their short opening times after being on hold for a while it turns out they made a mistake and will refund me the ticket within the next 48 hours a very convenient mistake to for a 360€ refund and not be able to look into this via an email inquiry only after i asked what compensation i will  for this i was offered 5000 avios points no thanks with that level of unreliability and british-airwaysd customer service i will make sure to never fly british-airways again i make sure to tell all my friends about this experience
 flew funchal to london gatwick just wanted to thank the staff on the aircraft for retrieving my game console was a pleasure to fly with a great airline like british-airways i left my console on the flight once i realised that i have left it behind i headed over to the help desk which is located in the british-airwaysggage control area the staff were friendly and happy to assist me the gentlemen made a call and while this was happening the air hostess appeared with my console in hand this has really made me appreciate flying with a high quality airline future flights to madeira are most certainly going to be with british-airways
 flew newcastle to san francisco via london heathrow with british-airways one issue after another the flight from newcastle boarded early but due to weather conditions in london we departed late we should have had a two hour lay notover for our connecting flight but arrived only thirty minutes prior to departure to san francisco and were told at disembritish-airwaysrkation that we had been re notrouted via washington our booked flight to san francisco also departed late and we sat in the lounge watching it push british-airwaysck we finally got on the washington bound aircraft but were again delayed in order to allow late arriving passengers from amsterdam to catch the flight the delay meant that the late departure was then caught up in a computer problem at heathrow thus delaying the flight further we eventually arrived in washington twenty minutes before the next connecting flight  not there was an announcement over the tannoy system for us to hurry up but no physical help available obviously we missed the flight and spent the next hour around about 2300 trying to find help at the check notin desk in a practically empty airport united acting on behalf of ba checked us onto a flight the following morning and the ba staff eventually found us a hotel room thirty minutes drive away ironically the ba personnel had been busy ensuring the the passengers from amsterdam that had caused the late departure made their connecting flight and were therefore not available to help us we were also downgraded to economy on the flight between washington and san francisco as business class was full we eventually got to san francisco about 22 hours after our scheduled arrival ba offered no compensation for either the time lost or the down notgrade in class they did pay for the taxi from the hotel and the cost of the pre notbooked but unused hotel in san francisco the airline blamed everything on circumstances and  not accept any responsibility not a good experience at all and nobody really cares
 manchester to london we were flying business class and expected a fast track boarding but alas the fast track boarding queue was longer than normal boarding queue then on the flight it was the case of 2 ends of the plane on either side of the curtain those in the front were offered a quick sandwich and a drink those behind had to purchase the short flight was on time the leg room in front of the plane was exactly same as at the rear except the middle seat was blocked off though it felt like business class in the plane on the ground pre boarding it certainly did not ba needs to improve and fast
  london to athens on the date of the flight i received a text message and an email saying my flight is full so i could check in my carry on luggage for free later on another text saying that i will have 46 minute delay i was at the airport almost 3 plus hours before checked in at the machines but it could not allocate my seat number then a british airways assistant came and successfully gave me my boarding pass with my seat number seating at a cafe i was checking the tv screen every 5 not10 minutes and it said delay 12:46 my flight was scheduled for 12:00 at 11:45 i tried to pass through security but the machine  allow me to scan my boarding pass and asked me to seek assistance the security officer told me that i lost the flight because my flight was at 12:00 and suggested me to go to counter c1 now at the counter c1 a lady told me that the flight was at 12:00 and i lost it while i was explaining that the flight will be delayed she made ph calls and tried to explain the whole situation then she told me to go through security because the british-airwaysr code on my boarding pass will be valid for 2 minutes went straight to my exit and it was packed from people sitting waited at the gate for another almost hour and in total the delay on arrival to athens was 1hr 20mins
 very disappointing i was scheduled on a british-airways flight to connect to a long haul flight at heathrow and having flown ba in the past it was very sad to see how ba service went down this year meal and drinks for purchase uninspired staff and delay on inbound flight i  fly a low cost carrier instead since that's exactly what ba now achieves many years ago it was  of the european flagship carriers and it was fun to fly ba now it's just another shrinking violet
 this was really a no frills business class this flight was part of trip with qatar airways unfortunately the london to doha was operated by british-airways the seat is cramped and really outdated compared to the other major airlines the ife was really poor with old screen system and poor range of options the meal was not good related to the price you have to pay the fas were really dull nothing wrong but no effort to communicate with passengers like fas from other airlines ba really need to refresh or renovate their business class cabin it might be excellent innovation british-airwaysck in mid 2000s but the industry has moved on
 british-airways is seriously lacking in all areas singapore to sydney return in economy fly the route often usually with qantas which are great the flight out to sydney is only 75 hours and over night  not most people are looking to maximise their sleep especially those who have come from london cabin crew were surly unhelpful and seemed rushed and disorganised after departure they took almost three hours to  the dinner service over and d with and turn off the lights so people could  some rest during the flight cabin crew chatted loudly and seemed unaware that people may actually want to rest and  some sleep the food is very average also two hours before landing they serve a pre landing breakfast snack of a sandwich wrapped in plastic no tea or coffee the competition is too strong for this route i  never use them again
  london heathrow to basel boarding: there are now so many 'priority boarding' passengers that all those who do not fall into this category are left to feel like second notclass citizens the new numbering system is likely to cement this impression further since i was traveling on a 'low notprice' ticket i found myself seated right at the british-airwaysck of the airplane yes ba appears intent on replicating england's class system  on board there was a delay of 40 minutes due to a french atc strike obviously this was not ba's fault but no drinks not even water was offered during the wait on the tarmac after take off the drinks trolley moved painfully slowly down the cabin why ba offer heated sandwiches further slowing down their bob service even further when only two ec cabin crew are serving in the first place is beyond me the no notcash policy further contributes to the snail notpace progress of the trolley the trolley and a cup of tea was within grasping distance as the captain announced we  be landing in ten minutes end of service some at the british-airwaysck quipped 'so you opted for the premium seats too' yes ba is a joke its attitude towards passengers its customers shameless and embritish-airwaysrrassing it was not until i had left the airport that i was able to  that cup of tea needless to say eurowings and easyjet do things much better
  miami to london heathrow a bit of a mixed british-airwaysg boarding at miami was conducted efficiently and the flight departed on time albeit that some passengers were still ting into their seats as the aircraft was pushed british-airwaysck so much for safety seat  not remain in the upright position resulting in an uncomfortable flight and subsequent aching british-airwaysck on arrival at heathrow also my wifes ife failed mid flight impossible to hear information from the flight deck these ageing 747s really are in desperate need of replacement the congealed chicken curry was disgusting and unpalatable the alternative pasta dish was deemed acceptable the minimal breakfast offering leaves a lot to be desired the only redeeming feature was the excellent service provided by the young enthusiastic cabin crew they must feel very demoralised given the poor quality product they have to support flight arrived early and luggage was delivered promptly
  prague to washington via london british-airways has turned out to be the worst airline i have flown unfortunately i am forced to fly them often from prg if i want to connect on their one world partner aa which i have exec plat status with ba charges for everything including water prg notlhr is on a small business class seat same as in economy dried up breakfast that was tasteless flight attendants that could not care less and when i asked for coffee told me they were landing soon 40 mins before landing and that i should have thought of it earlier london to washington  was on a broken down 747 seat sofa which you are supposed to lie on broke down and caved in on the floor had to be moved twice before they found functioning seat food was dried up beef with red that gave me a headache after two sips entertainment system has about 40 movies compared to about 200 options on aa flights overall horrible experience the extra added costs for flying over lhr and paying extra  tax is ridiculous ba what is it about your flights prg notlhr with your onboard luggage allowance only they charge usd 100 for a checked in luggage even to emerald partners  horrible food aircraft lhr and transfer experience good luck ba will avoid at all costs included a picture from the british-airwaysthroom which was broken
  cape town to london i can report a positive experience on our flight from the moment we boarded cabin crew were polite and efficient and provided a high notclass service throughout seats 4e/f suffer a bit from poor storage space and a lack of privacy but they are the best for a couple glasses were kept topped notup even before take notoff the menu provided four choices of both starter and mains and all the dishes were both well notpresented and well notcooked talking to cabin crew it seems that staff are now being trained to prepare and present food with greater care and this really showed on the flight the ife screen was the usual low resolution with a limited selection of films still no wifi of course take notoff and landing was on schedule and announcements from the cockpit had that typical air of friendly professionalism an excellent flight overall
  bangkok to london heathrow despite all the negative reviews i decided to fly with ba on my recent trip to europe on this route ba has a daylight flight i ca not stand midnight plus departure and night flight where you ca not sleep anyway and arrive at your destination wasted more luggage allowance in premium economy and they advertised what seemed to be a comfortable cabin and stylish service the fare was also pretty good in the end i have to admit my mates were right this was a let down all along my issues were the following i purchased a ticket in premium economy the advertised seats on the ba thailand website were reflecting the newer version when in fact not  of the 777 not200 which operates the lhr notbkk notlhr route have been refitted the seat date from the early 2000's  not almost two decades ago and i had to pay 35 pounds each way to select my seat come on  yes i got my amenities kit a better pillow british papers and pre notdepartures drinks a full british-airwaysr and plenty of drinks to keep me going for 12hr plus but the seat is old not that comfy the ife belongs to the late 90's and is a disgrace to the industry great sound good headset but rubbish tiny screen with a poor picture quality i spent 12hr looking at the ceiling as i could not see squat the seat itself is way outdated and the cabin/seat were dirty it was however a bit better out of lhr but still not that great the meal service was not good out of bkk bar service did not have peanuts or savory snack  not just a napkin main dish was ok but appetizer and dessert a cheap joke no cheese nor crackers not enough at all you are left starving and in economy it is even worst i have to say it was better on the return leg and will give you more details in a bit cabin crew told me they just reverted to the old style as they have had way too many complaints and the j/c had a brand new a la carte service as well  cabin crew operating both legs were great  not professional approachable and present in the cabin every 30mins with drinks out of lhr the main meal was this time pretty good including cheese and crackers and a much better appetizer plus desert the only false note was the meal pre notselection you  served first as they do with special meals  not but do not offer you any drinks you have to wait for a very long time by then my meal was cold and i sent it british-airwaysck they did replace it right away but this was clearly a waste of time pre notselecting your meal means you are sure to  your choice of casserole and that you wish to be served at the same time then others so the british-airwaysr is right behind and  can enjoy a glass of red with is steak pax with special meals service can wait as the crew have way more to hand out and these veggies lovers often do not drink anyway other than that it was this time a decent meal having said that there was no middle service which meant 9 h between lunch and breakfast without even a snack not acceptable on such a long haul funny enough the bkk notlhr feature three meals so why not on the lhr notbkk leg  ba could be so much better they have a great force but way too many cost cutting left and right  not and should have upgraded all their fleet at least 5 years ago it is clear to me the ceo is running ba to the ground and needs to  the sack by share holders sor rather than later 
 after 3 hour delay at airport flight destined for verona with arrival time of 2135 was rerouted to venice meaning bus transfer and arrival at 230am we passsengers were informed minutes before boarding plane of this change i had planned to stay the night with a friend who was going to pick me up at the airport at such an unsociable hour of the morning i could no longer disturb her i explained all this to ba who advised me that a rep  help me find a hotel and i  be reimbursed on arrival i was brusquely told by a ba rep to go online and find my own accommodation after a more than 5 hour delay my ph had no british-airwaysttery life i was left to borrow a fellow passenger's ph and search for the cheapest motel near the airport  not miles away from where i should have been it transpires ba knew there had been technical problems in the morning of the flight  not yet sent passengers an email urging us to  to the airport even earlier i wasted 5 hours at gatwick when i could have carried on working also had i known  have tried to  on an earlier flight or postp our journey to top it all when all 150 passengers finally arrived at the deserted airport of verona at 230 am  not no taxis ba had not thought of contacting local taxis informing them of a queue of tired clients further wait not only had i missed my dinner reunion to my astonishment british-airways has refused to reimburse my hotel bill stating that they had after all got me to my destination i had not even counted the extra taxi bills i incurred £45  not but i did expect ba to reimburse the 50€ hotel as a goodwill gesture not impressed
 flew british-airways from madrid to london heathrow an aircraft full of people we were being asked to check notin our hand luggage or in some cases to leave it by the aircraft and pick it up upon arrival i must say i find this irritating as i had  piece of luggage within the rules other people did not those should be asked to do this i truly felt as if i were in a low cost airline which is sad to see short nothaul with ba never again
  tel aviv to london we arrived at the airport with a lot of time due to the stories of how long security can take the stories were true although it is actually a very efficient and well organised airport they just have very thorough border and immigration services as well as all passengers face enhanced security scanning of hand luggage etc there were limited priority options available for first class passengers although i suspect that is more down to the airport than british-airways the lounge provided is a third party  and is the same for business and first and isnt really acceptable if it was just business then it  be ‘fine i guess but there is not very much seating the food offerings were almost non existent and drinks were limited even the main coffee machine was broken so there was another very complicated machine with all instructions only in hebrew at the gate there was the usual ‘priority boarding queue as well as the regular queue but the priority queue included all first and club passengers as well as all oneworld emerald sapphire and ruby members  not which is a lot of people whilst it is nice to offer a perk to all of those members there really should be another queue for first and oneworld emerald as the queue was quite long the service on board didnt start off very well for me as due to some confusion amongst the crew i got missed out when crew were offering drinks amenity kits etc and after seeing every  was finished and the crew were all relaxing at the front i had to go to the galley and ask they were very apoloic and provided excellent service for the rest of the flight but those kind of mistakes really shouldnt happen in first the seat is comfortable and offers a reasonable level of privacy and storage space annoyingly the ife has to be stowed for take off and landing which limits how much you can watch it was the thales entertainment system so the quality was reasonable and with a fairly good selection of things to watch the food and drinks on board were all excellent including a delicious veal cheek main course and some wonderful wines that went toher very well aside from the hiccup at the beginning the whole experience on board felt very attentive and special it  have been nice to have been referred to by name which i have had before on ba and with other airlines even in business class on arrival the priority british-airwaysgs came out incredibly quickly and were on the belt before we got there which was impressive as immigration had also been very quick overall this was a very nice flight with a solid product and excellent crew let down only by the ground service in israel i used avios and a companion voucher for this flight so it worked out excellent value for my
  london to tel aviv arrived at heathrow at about 5pm expecting it to be very busy but check and security felt like it was 10pm very easy and quick process which included regular rather than fast track security as we didnt follow the signs properly we used galleries south lounge and first impressions were actually pretty poor although they did later improve the food offering on arrival was a few sandwiches soup and some dry cake this wasnt really acceptable at all although about an hour after we arrived the evening meals were laid out and there was a good selection of hot and cold dishes which were quite tasty drinks overall were good as always with british-airways although champagne is only served on request and the quality of the  provided was really quite appalling in terms of seating there was enough for all the passengers in there and it was quite busy and due to it being broken up into different areas it felt like a nice place although better variety in seating including some more comfortable chairs  be appreciated as well as a bit of modernising this biggest failing was the staff in the lounge which were more similar to staff in a factory canteen than what you find in competitors lounges smiles are free and go a long way and whilst being unobtrusive can be a good quality eerily walking around slightly like a zombie seruptitiously clearing your table without any interaction whatsoever was just plain odd the other area which i find completely below standard are the toilets whilst they are kept clean and there are some nice touches with flowers etc the general standard of the toilet decor was more like a cheap gym locker room the regular heathrow airport toilets are far far nicer and to a higher quality whilst the individual toilet cubicles with self contained wash areas are nice there arent really enough and some regular wash room facilities and urinals as well  make it easier on board me and my friend had the centre two seats at the very british-airwaysck of the cabin this meant that we british-airwayssically had our own private suite as well as direct aisle access these seats are fantastic when travelling with some and as good as any business offering from any airline in terms of comfort privacy and access unfortunately this was an ancient 777 with the old ife which is a completely unacceptable product in terms of resolution selection and even the fact that some screens wont even stay in place and fold themselves away british-airways need to have an active plan to refurbish or replace all of these aircraft end of story even the thales system is showing its age now but this rockwell collins  makes vhs tapes look state of the art the cabin crew were slightly mixed in terms of level of service and experience some were clearly not in sync with each other when serving drinks and meals etc and some were rather abrupt and unfriendly others however were absolutely wonderful and made the whole flight a wonderful experience food and drinks on board were actually quite good although the on board service was not the new club world  on this route yet overall it was a very enjoyable flight and as i booked using avios and a companion voucher it was exceptional value for my having said that i  have still considered it good value even if paying cash
  kuala lumpur to madrid via london my first time flying ba and i had very low expectations fortunately my experience was pleasant as the seats were generally comfortable and overall service was good the service kul notlhr was brusque meal was served not long after take off and my child was already sleeping as it was past midnight i had asked if we could have it later but the reply was a curt no and that they could not give it to us later nor  they have any snacks to offer so if we got hungry we  just have to wait more than 8 hours later for the next meal luckily on the return route we had a very courteous cabin crew who spoke politely both aircrafts appeared new and the seats were wide enough for us some people complained about the entertainment unit under the seats what i did not like though is that the arm rest could not be kept up totally between the 2 seats so that my child could lie across his seat and mine the armrest kind of went up to a max of 80 degree angle the seat pockets were very small so there's very little that can kept inside the toilets were generally clean but the toilet seat lids did not work properly they always fall british-airwaysck down and there was never seat liners food was below average
❎   madrid to london heathrow on a busy monday evening in november was an entirely mixed affair boarding was from the satellite terminal which was efficient and well managed boarding was rather slow as too many people were allowed to bring aboard large amounts of luggage this resulted in some british-airwaysgs being removed and placed into the hold some passengers were poorly behaved and argued with the staff every single seat was occupied this was quite hard on the staff a trendy safety instruction took place with a video of certain uk british-airwayssed tv personalities this was in english only the inflight service was very poor i ordered a sandwich and a drink and had my receipt chucked at me disembritish-airwaysrkation was slow again due to the large amount of luggage i regard this as a health and safety matter british-airways is not what it was and on this route there are alternatives offering better service
❎   flew british-airways from bologna to london heathrow we arrived at bologna airport to be told at the british-airwaysg check in that the plane had been overbooked and that we  have to wait until boarding closed before we  know if there was a seat for us we were both amazed and surprised since we had booked this return flight several weeks earlier and had arrived at the airport in good time the member of staff dealing with us was particularly brusque and unhelpful and the only information that we were given was a typed sheet setting out the fact that if we did not travel we  be able to claim compensation for us this was not acceptable since we had to be in the lake district the following day we were eventually allowed onto the plane but  not have made it if it had not been for a fellow passenger who seemed to know how to  around the queues in this situation i thought that these problems were only found on the well known cut price airlines
❎   my husbritish-airwaysnd and i booked our hymoon to italy through american airlines which unknowingly routed us to their partner airlines british-airways we ran immediately into trouble when we received an email notice that our flights have been changed and we now had a 40 minute layover at london heathrow and we  not arrive in rome in the am as planned we decided to give it a shot regardless we arrived at bwi and discovered we were not on an aa flight and had packed more british-airwaysgs than ba  allow we had three checked british-airwaysgs instead of 2 and british-airways only allows  checked british-airwaysg or you pay close to $100 for additional luckily the gentlemen at the counter checked the british-airwaysg at no charge i ca not say the same for the rest of our trip we found that the flight was full and they had not placed our seats toher for a 65 hr flight and we had 2 middle seats the neighbors on our flight refused to swap seats originally then after some pity complaining a lovely woman swapped we arrived into london around 9am late of course and after running to the next terminal in an attempt to make our connection we missed our flight and were unable to make it through security the ba representative told us the next flight was full and we  have to wait until 5pm we again explained that we were on our hymoon and had afternoon ticket reservations in rome the ba representative was then able to find two seats on a 12pm flight  not so we missed our ticket reservations but were able to  into rome for dinner upon our return flights we attempted three times to reserve seats online via british-airways app and web learning from before and the website kept giving us an error screen even though the charge was pending on my paypal account we eventually had to make an international call and pay $174 to ensure we were able to sit next to each other on the 8 hr flight home though we could not select seats for our connecting flight to london once we arrived at rome to check  not we got hit with the $100 additional british-airwaysggage fee we we tried to explain the representative refused to comp the british-airwaysg upon arriving at the gate my ticket was pinged for having an extra british-airwaysg that was not paid for luckily we had the receipt from paying 2 hrs earlier otherwise i imagine we 've had to shell out $100 again we are crossing our fingers for a safe trip home as we are again delayed on our flight from rome to london if you fly british-airways prepare to be nickled and dimed at every part of your journey 
 flew british-airways from london heathrow to johannesburg plane at t5 satellite c so used b galleries lounge which was quiet and pleasant efficient boarding seats 50j/k on upper deck which provided good privacy despite proximity to toilets mixed crew fas and ours were young and enthusiastic in notflight service good with a notable improvement in the quality of food ie courses delivered individually to seats and main courses not cooked to a crisp ife lagging behind that offered by competitors with small screens and limited movies breakfast included four hot options which were more palatable than usual overall a good flight although we look forward to promised improvements in 2018
london heathrow to brussels i had to travel for a surgery that had to be d in belgium going there the staff at check notin in were amazing as i had missed my plane she did everything possible for me to be on the next flight at a good price however coming british-airwaysck to london the staff were quite rude and not acknowledging i got on the plane and asked if i could have help to place my hand luggage into the locker as i could not carry anything nor lift my hand due to my operation the first staff member at the entrance told me that i had to ask a member of staff closer to my seat if no  could help then he will try to come so thats what i did but the member of staff refused as she told me that she wasnt allowed to carry a british-airwaysg unless i help her and even after explaining the situation she just ignored it and just left me al with my suitcase luckily another passenger heard me and carried my british-airwaysg to the top and helped my  it down at the end i work in retail and i know about customer service but very disappointed with my expirience coming british-airwaysck especially on the plane i am very angry by this situation and next time i will think twice before choosing the company again
" 
flew london to san francisco british-airways provided a functional disinterested service on this ten hour flight we were given what was necessary and certainly no more ignored for five hours not even a glass of water offered and it was made clear that the staff were happy to do the british-airwaysre minimum and no more if you have to go with british-airways do but if you can avoid them then i  in the interest of fairness i have informed the customer service team at british-airways of my experience  not so far i have been ignored hence writing this review"
 london heathrow to seoul incheon i was flying my return leg british-airwaysck to korea after a christmas vacation i had not had a pleasant experience on my initial leg and unfortunately had no better experience on the return to start with i was unable to pre order my meal on line due to a technical fault having not had my selection available on the outbound leg in business class i wanted to ensure i had something for my return i could not pre book and of course when offered the meal by the cabin crew they had again run out of 50% of the available selections quite disgraceful i was also unable to check in on line so i was directed by staff to use the kiosk at the airport which also did not work eventually i made it passed the staff and was allowed to queue for the business class check in the rest of the airport process after that was smooth this time i sat at the rear of the business class cabin in the window seat this meant that i did not have to step over somebody else feet and legs if i wanted to  out of my chair in flight of course i had to pay extra $'s for the seat selection in business class  not a point which i have made before about being very unhappy about in a premium cabin the flight was uneventful on this occasion i had a very warm crew for which i appreciated overall i still feel that ba is just too cheap on it's product and this is not an acceptable practice especially in a premium class frankly even though they were the cheaper ticket price by the time i had paid extra for the seat and not had my meal choices available i  have been better off flying another carrier
 seoul incheon to london heathrow this was my first flight on ba for many years as a brit i was actually looking forward to flying them in order to return home for christmas on board the relatively new b787 i was disappointed the fare i paid on this occasion was relatively good value for a j class cabin  not in my view however it was extremely disappointing to see that you have to pay to select your seat in j class i do not know of and have not ever flown another airline which charges you for this and i certainly do not appreciate it i was seated in row 1 by the window my first experience in this cabin was a shock when i realised i was looking straight into the face of the passenger sitting next to me and further that i had to step over the legs of the passenger in row 2 to  into and out from my seat the tray table did not sit straight when pulled out for service even in row 1 by the time the cabin crew came to take my meal order they were already telling me that two of the available options had already run out this left me taking a korean option on a flight on ba where the majority of the passengers seemed to be non notkorean clearly something wrong with the meal ratios they offer a serve yourself snack british-airwaysr in flight i went to the galley at  point and there was very little available to take food wise  not it was mostly just drinks it also seemed to be a fixed meal time  not something else i do not appreciate in business class these days when dine on demand is a far better option for passengers the ife selection was nothing more than average i found the overall selection somewhat limited compared to other carriers the service and product simply left me feeling that ba is way behind other carriers and i concluded that i  not make a point of flying with them again on a long haul route in a premium cabin
 flew cape town to london with british-airways its hard to think of a good thing about this flight on the outward journey i was in an aisle seat next to me was somebody who was too large to comfortably be able to occupy a middle seat the crew could have helped the poor person out by offering an aisle but they made no attempt so three people suffered cramped conditions for 11 hours the food is awful poor quality and with poor selection of wines  not cheap spanish wine with no choice the cabin was over heated it was the most uncomfortable flight i have ever taken until my return flight  not entertainment system was not working  not ancient plane same miserable food this airline used to be good now it is awful
 london to bahrain club world and they certainly like to pack folk into a business class cabin in a 2 not4 not2 configuration which is out of date and hardly worthy of business class cabin compared to the likes of qatar emirates etihad which are far more superior the plane was old along with a tired cabin and dirty unkempt british-airwaysthroom british-airwayssins that had permanent staining which need replacing on this flight good choice of foods with attentive staff cost cutting was in evidence in the amenity british-airwaysg you  the presentation of food trays and the personnel service had g it's more akin to economy also a real negative point is your at heathrows newest terminal & guess what you are transported to your aircraft by buses a shining example of what is supposed to be a modern airport this flight is definitely not 5 star and a 3 star rating is where this airline should sit plane was delayed 45 mins & arrived 25 mins late so not exactly a good timekeeping record either ife was poor with old films that they call new releases no where near on a par with qatar airways
 london to philadelphia ticket booked was an amex companion ticket so effectively family of 4 travelled for £25k in business class return so very good value positives  not b747 on both journeys was refurbished so very clean and great ife cabin quiet and crew amazingly helpful t5 lounge fine flight on time bags off very quickly negatives  not food on on both legs was not great salad poor and main beef meal very average pudding which is normally the show stopper  not not great in previous years food been excellent return journey just the same  not except for the crew this time being outstandingly helpful we were travelling with a british-airwaysby and a toddler and the crew could not do enough to help the real test of the crew was on landing at lhr we were walking up the jetty and my 3 year old daughter was sick all over me we were stood on the jetty trying to sort the situation and all the crew after a long flight came to help us they were amazing they did not have to as they were d for the day ba are ting so much stick at the moment  not their hard product is fine if you are redeeming a companion ticket but not if you are paying in excess of £15k the crew lift this product to a much higher level
 british-airways short haul business class is nothing more than an economy class seat and maximum 31 inch pitch with lounge access and a meal thrown in so is it worth paying three times the cost of an economy ticket ba recently introduced business class on domestic routes and as i got a decent price for booking well in advance decided to try it out checking in was efficient and the galleries club lounge adequate no comparison whatsoever with asian or middle eastern airline lounges priority boarding although announced did not make any difference as economy and business class passengers were in the same queue and confused having maneuvered into the cramped seat i was offered a hot towel as soon as i sat down i could not decide whether to be amused or embritish-airwaysrrassed by the new celebrity cast safety video it was more spot the stars than listen to the safety instructions but i guess it was something different ba was trying out the service on board was surprisingly efficient and swift soon after take off a tasty snack and british-airwaysr service with premium brands was offered on this  hour flight the service was good considering a  hour flight despite a boeing 767 2x2x2 layout the cabin felt claustrophobic to me this was no different than economy seating with virtually no leg room how can this be branded as business class is the extra cost justified to fly club europe absolutely not
 i requested asian vearian food both ways including my return flight from oakland to gatwick on the 6th november but i was very disappointed that my requirement was not fulfilled  i was told that on my connection flight i have to pick up my luggage and then check it again at phoenix airport for connection flight which i never heard before as normally all the airlines do the checking luggage transfer themselves and passengers just have to do security checks and board the flight when i reached phoenix first security took long time to clear then luggage took time to come then i had to go on the different level to check in then down to go through security again to board my flight on my return flight from oakland to gatwick when i went to the check in luggage i was told by the staff at the desk that tsa will break my lock to check through my luggage so please keep it unlocked  i requested asian vearian food but when i got my special meal it was cholesterol fat free diet when i mentid this to the staff who gave me this food she said thats what you asked for but i said sorry i didnt as on the food label clearly says 18a and my seat no is 18k so how is this my food she still didnt believe me instead of apology she said i have to  british-airwaysck on this matter to provide you food as we might not have spare food to offer you after 15 mins of wait once she serving all the passengers she came to me and told me that if you want i can offer you full english breakfast i said but i am vearian she said i dont have any other option 
 am continually disappointed by british-airways it seems they are now in a race with ryanair and easyjet to become the worst carrier in and out of the uk flew düsseldorf to london their lounge at dus is closed but their check notin staff does not know that she sent me up there i have a connexion at jfk and i showed her the boarding passes but she  not interline my british-airwaysg to their partner aa and i had to recheck it now not only do they not serve a second meal on the 11 nothour flight lhr notlax but now they want £2 for a can of coca cola that they pay 15p for usually you should always fly across the ocean on a european carrier but with boac i recommend finnair or american with their one world alliance what is the point
 london to santiago cabin crew generally helpful and friendly cabin a bit grubby; crumbs nuts and grime in evidence on the flight home as i took my seat i saw a bit of the wrapper of the ear plugs they give out which seemed to have been left over from the previous flight  not evidence that whoever wields the vacuum cleaner before the passengers board needs to be a bit more thorough the alcoholic drinks were all pleasant the food was of variable quality as was the coffee n british-airwaysd some a bit mediocre some good many have commented on the somewhat odd seat arrangement and i found it a bit of a palaver to have to carefully step over another sleeping passenger's legs trying not to wake them up the other problem with that configuration is the video screen has to be stowed at take off and landing which means you ca not watch it as you can in economy when the screen is on the british-airwaysck of the seat in front of you on both flights i found that my screen seemed to be broken and  not lock in position so that i  have to look at it at an angle i solved the problem by stuffing a rolled up magazine in the hinge bit but then i had to take it out every time i got out of my seat another problem with the configuration is that the storage space is minimal; apart from the overhead lockers there is only a small drawer and that adds to the litter problem after you have taken off the polythene wrappers for your headphs and blanket or the paper ring around your napkin what do you do with it er drop it on the floor i did manage to sleep quite well though the pillow you are provided with is very thin on the flight british-airwaysck they gave me another  when i asked another small problem is that there is no individual air conditioning vent for your seat and if you take off your jacket sweater or whatever the lack of storage space means it has to go in the overhead locker if you have already filled up the little drawer and i do not want to seem a bit picky but although the in notflight entertainment has a good choice of films the menu system for seeing what they are is a bit irritating; they are all divided into categories such as comedy thrillers etc but no a notz all in all it was not an unpleasant experience but i  advise ba if they were interested in my advice that they need to clean the planes more often and more thoroughly and re notthink the seat configuration
 london to new york jfk in club world after reading very mixed reviews here i also saw that ba were upgrading standards on flights to nyc in particular and was looking forward to my flight should not have been so optimistic as this is still a business class that belongs in the 1980's aircraft was tatty to be polite about it worn carpets seat with various malfunctioning or broken items washrooms grimy from the word go staff tried hard to offer a modicum of good service but the so called food improvements were really not much better than other premium economy cabins i have flown when i have to pay for the ticket ba talk a lot about their premium standards but even when you pay to notdollar for business class the standards are well below even their us counterparts complete rip notoff sums it up
 my wife and i booked two round trip business class air tickets from johannesburg to victoria falls with british-airways / comair it turned out that our business class seats were not any different from the seats in the economy class: they had exactly the same width and pitch actually british-airways simply separated several seats in the front from the rest of the aircraft cabin with a curtain and called this a business class moreover our pre notflight accommodations were not any better than those of the economy class passengers because british-airways does not even have a lodge for business class passengers in victoria falls yes during the flight we were served sparkling wine and snacks but does this difference substantiate my paying for two round trip tickets $1372 rather than $703 which  have been the cost of the economy class tickets
 london to mumbritish-airwaysi the electrics at my seat were not working this may have been related but the remote control that was completely broken with loose  wires etc  not the call button light kept coming on and off on its own it was impossible for me to control this and at the time that i did actually want to contact the flight attendant i had to use my husbritish-airwaysnd's remote control to do so  not because the connection was loose on my remote it meant that things were changing on my tv screen without me being able to control it eg i  press play on the screen then the program  pause or start rewinding without me doing anything because my remote controller was broken it  not return properly into the socket and kept 'pinging' british-airwaysck out this was  annoying when you are trying to relax in your seat the tv screen was  faulty the usual 'push and release' button did not work i had to push the button and then just try to 'pull' the screen it was very tough even the cabin crew could not release it properly my footrest was very stiff and hard to manoeuvre on my own  not my husbritish-airwaysnd had to help every time i wanted to move this my husbritish-airwaysnds footrest was  broken  not the charging socket at my seat did not work so i could not charge my ph or laptop for the entire flight my husbritish-airwaysnds charging socket also did not work the flight attendant told me that this was an issue on some of the other seats in our row this is not related to my seat however the storage unit above my seat/row kept opening throughout the flight the attendant  shut it and then it   open this happened during take off and landing as well as throughout the flight  for this level of airline and club world seat it is not acceptable that you should have to rely on your personal equipment  this return flight was the first time that i have flown business class we have spent tens of thousands of pounds on our american express card to earn the points required and to generate the companion voucher for us to be able to fly business class for our hymoon whilst the outbound flight was great i was very disappointed with the return flight and shocked by the poor quality of the seat the hostess tried to reset my screen which made no difference and in fact the situation got worse once i had tried to turn on the screen and once it the hostess had attempted a re notset; after that the screen just kept flicking on and off for the remaining 35 hrs of the flight as you can imagine it is very annoying to have a screen flick on and off with no way of controlling it it was impossible to turn the screen off completely
 i travelled to johannesburg from london heathrow on sunday 22nd october on flight ba55 and my husbritish-airwaysnd was meant to travel with my two daughters on the same flight on 23rd october they were refused boarding on the grounds that children cannot travel with a single parent to south africa there was no such requirement on booking the tickets via ba's website and there was no notification of this by the airline at any stage the requirement is not even on the front page of the embritish-airwaysssy's website but well hidden under drop down menus usually when there are requirements like for esta for entry into us ba sends a prompt however there was nothing in this case ba had on its system that i the other parent had travelled ba already reach johannesburg a day before the ba counter staff at the airport refused to help my husbritish-airwaysnd who was travelling with a 4 and 7 year old with any alternative instead they directed to use the website to cancel tickets after being given the wrong email address first when finally managed to  in touch with customer relations they refused to refund the ticket cost only refunded taxes 25% of total the overall service and the way it was dealt was extremely stressful at the airport and off notputting they said they  use the complain to improve their processes but will not refund in excess of gbp 2k in tickets as they were cancelled prior to the flights upon refused boarding even the return flights and not within 24hrs of booking other airlines offer alternatives but here the attitude was extremely dismissive even though both my husbritish-airwaysnd and i are frequent travellers and have silver cards of their executive program i will avoid travelling ba even for work after this event have received better treatment from low cost airlines in the past
 heathrow to lyon the worst customer service i have ever experienced i arrived at the airport a good 2 hours before the flight only to be told that the flight is overbooked and that i could not check in after a long wait to ascertain if any will not be turning up i was told i can go on a different flight  not the problem being that the only available flight was the  going out the following morning so i missed a whole day's business meeting and was forced to do the round trip home and british-airwaysck to the airport in a matter of  day when i queried the fact that i was unable to board i was told that overselling the flight was normal  not all airlines do it the fact that all of them do it of course is not a justification nor explanation i was casually advised to read the small print in the future on the way british-airwaysck from my destination in order to avoid the same thing happening i decided to check in online 24 hours before however i was again denied a check in and was put on a stand by apparently the return flight is overbooked again i do not understand how it is possible that the product/service that i have purchased i can not use how can it be legal that the company has no responsibility to honour their contractual obligation to provide me the service that i have duly purchased a good 4 months in advance the disregard for its customers and the sheer arrogance of this huge inept company is beyond pale on top of that the company's decision to no longer serve coffee/tea and food on board is unacceptable the ba has made a foolish decision to behave like a bud airline but still keep charging premium prices i certainly will never travel the ba ever again
 absolutely appalling service from ba i booked seats with extra leg room with a ba representative to ensure i was ting the seats we needed on arrival at the aircraft we did not have those seats our return flight was the same so i applied for a refund after a lot of british-airwaysck and forth with ba they started paying it british-airwaysck in drips and drabs not the full amount  not so far i have received half of the amount owed i traveled 6 months ago  not i have called a dozen times emailed and filled out forms and the last i heard was that some  contact me and  sort this matter out  not no  has called british-airwaysck in 2 months now when i call they say “you cant chase anymore you have to await for some to call you” ba you are a disgrace i have been patient and you have d nothing worst airline i have ever had to deal with
 kingston to london gatwick it was my first time flying with british-airways and to be very hst it is my last time ever flying with them i had a horrid experience going to my destination as well as coming british-airwaysck from my destination 
 heathrow to barcelona reliable no longer feels like travelling with a premium airline very functional but unfortunately at a cost flight took off late because luggage for a passenger needed to be off loaded however arrived on time in barcelona excellent information from the flight deck cabin crew robotic and lacked personality enough has already been said about charges for food and drink overall falling well below the standards of the competition great pity really
 singapore to london my feedbritish-airwaysck seems to mirror many other users here  not ba standards are just ting worse and worse and i am talking about business class which i thought they  maintain the cabin interior was worn and quite grubby the seats terrible and now must be  of the poorest for long haul business class the meal and presentation is really a joke and on my previous long haul biz trip i got better food in lufthansa premium economy cabin staff were quite friendly although they do hide in the galley a lot chatted to  of them who said so many customers are complaining and even deserting ba because of the fall in standards  not i'm not surprised and i for   not use them again for long haul time for senior management changes as the present ceo clearly has no clue how to run what was once a premium airline now they do little more than a low notcost and easyjet for  is far superior and nicer for short hops in europe
british-airways appear to be taking positive steps to lift their game the service on this flight was flight was materially better than that previously experienced the quality of the food served had lifted materially the staff were helpful the big downside is that club europe sets remains stock standard economy seats  not with the middle seat blocked off the pitch is tight  not too tight in my view another couple of centimetres  be welcome overall a better ba experience
 heathrow to dubritish-airwaysi this is a warning of what to expect from british-airways  if they continue to treat passengers this way i can see the airline very quickly ting into difficulty the reply i got from the airline below just brushed all the issues i raised under the carpet living in egypt for 10 years i became i frequent flyer with egyptair if i wanted to change the date of travel with them they only charged me £60 ba want to charge me over £500 and because i wanted to cancel my flight and go with a better airline they were only prepared to give me a £950 refund even though i  have given them over 2 months notice this airline is on my black list makes me ashamed to think this is my national airline but never again will i book another flight with ba there was no priority seat booking unless i paid another £38 extra there was no priority boarding i booked seat 23d but this was mysteriously changed at check in to 24e ba emailed me to confirm a change in the booking but did not say what that change was i did not make any changes in premium economy i was wedged in like a sardine in a seat that is only 1 wider than economy with a few inches extra leg room is this some kind of joke i had to double check that i was not in economy as there is only  seat difference in a row the tough chicken meal was diabolical the cabin light over the bulkhead luggage bins was jammed on and  not go out so no sleep whatsoever i really do not see the necessity for this light anyhow as the non smoking lights and tv screen light give emit sufficient light anyway i ended up paying £300 extra for nothing and am extremely disappointed with this flight a few days previously i flew premium economy with virgin atlantic return from barbritish-airwaysdos and the difference between ba and virgin is worlds apart
 flew british-airways from tokyo haneda to london heathrow this is  of the worst flights i have ever had the seats were so weak that i felt every movement of the passangers around me especially the guy in front really old entertainment system and my friend next to me was missing the audio outlet food was also horrible
 london to toronto by now it is nothing new anymore that the ceos very aggressive cost cutting affected all classes including first & business which called “club world” does not deserve it name because it is simply appalling again it is on the cost of the customer and eventually on the aircrews who have to work harder because there are smaller teams  it is not surprising that ba current ranking bounced british-airwaysck to 40th from 26th in 2016 fact is that this airlines which prefers rather to invest its my in flashy nonsense commercial rather than in its products does clearly not deserve to be recommended once a grand airline today just another 2 star airline like there are so many
 new york to london heathrow  first class check in at t7 in jfk was quick polite staff provide better service than those at heathrow the concorde room is just a few metres after security  it is nice enough with a good range of seating and dining booths but washroom / shower facilities are downmarket selected a couple of a la carte menu choices and these were nicely presented and tasty boarding was reasonably efficient  and staff onboard offered usual boarding drinks pyjamas etc delay of about 30 mins on departure was made up during the flight i opted to sleep straight after take off  seat comfort is okay if a little narrow  90 minutes before arrival i had some fruits and pastry for breakfast  accompanied by some good coffee while i only needed minimal service onboard  the staff were courteous and efficient  and they are  of very few good things left after ba after their ceo seems to have decided to alienate loyal customers of 40 years  arrival into t5 at heathrow  b satellite at 0515 was absolute bedlam and a reason i  choose another airline on this route we wanted for 4 satellite trains to pass by totally full before we could even  to the main terminal  not  to find immigration in total  disorganised chaos i buy and pay for my own tickets  and do feel that ba is now grossly overpriced forge standards they provide please  a ceo that values quality over bean notcounting
 gatwick to marrakech the cabin crew was lazy and rude refusing to sell a pack of sweets which  have not taken more than 30 seconds  for the duration of half of the flight they sat in the british-airwaysck having a break during which all service stopped half way through the flight we ordered some sweets from the food menu the lady that passed said that they will come british-airwaysck once they had finished serving some other customers after 30 minutes we pressed the bell for assistance and  of the staff came to rudely explain that they hadnt finished serving other customers even though n of the 3 staff members was seen serving any we waited 20 minutes before pressing the bell again which was ignored after another 10 minutes my partner went to the british-airwaysck of the cabin to order the pack of sweets but the cabin crew explained that they are having a break now and that they stopped serving we tried for over 1 hour to buy some jaffa cakes which  have taken less than 30 seconds but it was too much to ask for ryanair or easyjet service is luxury compared to the service of this cabin crew i will not use ba again if i can avoid it and cannot recommend this airline 
 this was my first time flying with british-airways from los angeles to london heathrow i was able to secure a window seat for myself without paying any fee during online check notin 24 hours prior to departure the british-airwaysggage drop notoff experience at lax and lhr was smooth at lax the ba staff tags your check notin british-airwaysgs at lhr you have to do it yourself the on notboard experience was good this was my first time sitting on the upper notdeck of a380 which had a special storage bin by the window armrest food options were consistent with what you find on most transatlantic flights chicken or pasta there was no wifi but ba had a good collection of movies i enjoyed ba's in notflight movie snack as well the flight map / tracker was not working on  segment which was a bit surprising overall i had a pleasant experience and  consider flying with ba again
 gatwick to cagliari proved to be a rather pleasant and well organised affair the website was easy to use and very clear i checked notin online and simply had to drop off my british-airwaysg i arrived very early for the flight and noted that there was quite a queue already the boarding process was quick and efficient and the interior of the aircraft was clean my seat was comfortable for a short flight the captain made clear and informative announcements and the two crew i could see worked very hard and were pleasant the crew made use of italian and were cheerful and professional my gripe is the awful use of marks and spencer food this has to be purchased and a good few items were not available there were no route maps and no entertainment systems the lavatory was clean disembritish-airwaysrkation was managed well
 shanghai to tampa via heathrow/gatwick we received deplorable customer service recently from british-airways i purchased business class tickets on 11/28/2016 for flights on september 30 2017 i purchased two tickets for a total of $967626 plus an additional $652 for seat assignments the problems occurred on our return flights we were booked october 17 2017 on ba168 shanghai to lhr  london with continuing service october 18 2017 from london gatwickto tampa we were disembritish-airwaysrking a cruise ship at the port of shanghai on october 17 2017 we checked in online 24 hours before our flights scheduled departure at 11:00 am on the evening of october 16 2017 the captain announced that the ship  not dock at the port as scheduled at 7:00 am in the morning on october 17 the captain announced that the chinese had shut down the port and were not allowing any ships to dock after these announcements we frantically tried to contact british-airways because we expected that we  miss our 11:00 am flight we were unable to do so we were informed that in order to exit china without a visa we needed to have proof of our flights leaving the country we were aware of this requirement we had not applied for a visa because we were only transiting from the ship to the airplane we knew that without a visa of valid flights out we  be escorted to the local chinese police station until we could arrange flights out of the country for obvious reasons we did not want to experience that situation we were able to contact a travel agent via e notmail our ph was not operating as we were at sea in chin  our agent was able to contact british-airways and explain our situation there was another flight that departed on october 18 which was 13 hours 40 minutes after our original flight that was flt ba 160 we were told here are your choices: 1 pay a change fee of $884 and be down graded to premium economy on both flights ba 160 and ba 2167  even though we  be able to make ba 2167 as it did not depart london lgw until 11:55 am on october 18 2017 2 pay an additional $6388 per person for a total of $12776 to keep our business class status on both flights we had already paid $1032826 for these tickets 3 disembritish-airwaysrk the ship and take our chances with chinese immigration option 2 was outrageous option 3 frightening we felt we had no choice but to choose option 1 the travel agent advised us to explain what had happened when we arrived at the airport at check notin and request our business class seats if they were available when we checked in at pvg we asked if there were business class seats available “yes several” was the response we explained what had happened and asked as a courtesy if we could have those vacant seats “yes for a cost of $12776 “ of course we refused to pay that amount we were then charged additional british-airwaysggage fees because as we had expected to be flying business class two suitcases were over the 50 lbs limit for economy while on board during that flight ba160 i went into the business class cabin and saw that there were indeed vacant seats when we arrived in london we again asked to be seated in our originally purchased seats were we on the same flight as originally scheduled but i was informed that our business class seats had already been assigned to other flyers apparently british-airways sold our seats or an upgrade to other passengers at our expense
 gatwick to marrakech generally a well organised flight and fairly full in y class my gripe is about the current food service this was a fairly long short nothaul flight scheduled for 3h 45m in which a reasonable meal service  be welcome and desirable after a lot of comments from others who have flown ba recently we bought food in the terminal before departure as the coho notice on board is very limited especially as much seems to be already 'sold out' the biggest issue is about the time taken to do the food selling it took almost all of the flight time for the crew to work through the plane to serve every row even though i observed that about 60% of passengers bought nothing of course this led to problems for those wishing to go to the toilets at the rear when food service starts at the front any passengers from front to middle have no access to aft toilets after the trolley has passed passengers resorted to using the forward toilets passing through business class which i assume was not welcomed by those passengers i overheard a crew member saying that they were not going to duty free sales as they were out of time it is ridiculous that this paid and limited service takes so long i remember the days when a british midland crew could serve a full cooked breakfast with tea or coffee to all 100 or so pax on a lhr to middlesbrough flight scheduled for 40 minutes or an aer lingus crew serving hot breakfast to all on a turbulent flight of 1 hr from dublin to london if ba want to differentiate themselves from low cost carriers then this is not the way to do it
 oakland to heathrow and this flight was fine the worst that could be said is that there is no magic that other airlines manage to provide left and arrived on time fa attentive and professional food reasonable and alcohol served in generous proportions my only real complaint was the inflight entertainment was rather poor with lots of old films and tv programmes and a mediocre choice of music
 london to sofia cabin crew were kind this is the only positive thing british-airways are now becoming as british-airwaysd as ryanair onboard passengers have to pay ridiculous amount of my even for a small bottle of water when i booked my flight from heathrow to sofia i was told i  a free checked in british-airwaysg for my british-airwaysby girl a day before my flight i decided to double check this and called their customer service line and the guy on the ph told me i need to pay for checked in british-airwaysg if i want  i told him that there should be  included for my british-airwaysby daughter but he said this is not true i asked him to double check this and he said he already did so i had to pay for a checked british-airwaysg £30 each way since i already had my suitcase packed next day as i went to the check in at heathrow i was asked how many british-airwaysgs do i want to check in i asked how many british-airwaysgs am i allowed to check in and the lady said i can check in two british-airwaysgs not  for my british-airwaysby and the  that ive paid for the previous day the thing is that i only had  suitcase since the guy on the ph told me i can only check  british-airwaysg if i pay for it first after i arrived in sofia i rang british airways and explained everything so they agreed they should refund the my theyve charged me for the additional british-airwaysg they said theyll refund the £30 for the london notsofia flight the same day and the other £30 fee for the sofia notlondon route in about a week time a month later i checked my online british-airwaysnking and saw theyve only refunded £30 for the outbound journey i rang them and theyve said they are sorry and theyll refund the remaining £30 within the next 3 days when i pointed that it should be fair and reasonable that i  a 20% discount voucher from my next flight price they said this is something british-airways do not offer 
 singapore to nassau via heathrow british-airways is becoming a dismal airline to fly with i will start with the worst and shocking aspect of my flight from heathrow to singapore on oct 23 there were bugs on the flight and i have bites all over my body at least at a dozen places one can suffer the british-airwaysd food service / behavior of cabin staff but having 's health compromised is unacceptable the toilets were filthy i was in the paid premium seat front row and i could smell the toilet from there the attitude of staff ranges of sweet to indifferent and curt sometime for no rhyme or reason the food is inconsistent and becomes a pain when you are on a long haul flight because there are no options available while flying from nassau to heathrow the dinner was fine but the breakfast i think it was a morning snack consisted of a croissant which was a cold lump coffee which was cold and a oats snack british-airwaysr i mean you cant  a croissant right the inflight entertainment was mediocre at best and remains much to be desired the screens in the singapore not heathrow sectors were ok to use but the heathrow to nassau sector were malfunctioning all the time i could feel the fingers of the passengers sitting behind me trying to function the 'touch screen'; more like punch screen the flights were mercifully on time and full marks for that this time it could learn well from airlines like singapore airlines which are pretty consistent and clean i am giving the airline 4 of 10 only for value for my
 flew london heathrow to madrid british-airways monopoly of the routes to spain have a serious impact on the quality ba owns iberia so theres no competition planes are the worst of the ba fleet check notin is a nightmare because they operate each others flight but the online check in does not recognize each others booking references really the worst of ba and iberia worlds toher
 london to zurich a bud airline at premium prices lots of late and cancelled flights pay for luggage food and drinks poor customer services even at silver level i have had flights cancelled in the past and after a long time on the ph offered an alternative flight from another airport no assistance for transport
 bari to gatwick more of the same all held toher by cockpit crew follows my review of the outbound leg a week british-airwaysck check in excellent not ba staff and security at bari a breeze boarding well organised cabin crew chatting to each other as i boarded and ignored me this is inexcusable flight fine ahead of schedule and good updates from cockpit didnt buy anything this time smell of coffee far better than the taste from previous experience gatwick south unpleasant tho not bas fault endless staircases broken escalator and a long walk to security where half the e notgates were out of action baggage hadnt arrived anyway despite being priority so delay at security irrelevant had an offer to upgrade to club for £89  not a joke as there is no lounge at bari and the onboard value is a max of £30 i do still like flying ba as much as i dont easy or ryanair but sinking to their levels will put ba out of business for short haul there is now little differentiator
 early morning 0710 flight london heathrow to gibraltar now i know that british-airways have started charging for food and drink on european flights but their service levels are dropping so low that they are now no better than ryanair or easyjet it might be m&s food but if you ca not  any that does not help we were seated at the rear of the cabin since ba started to charge i have noticed that there is only 1 food cart which started at the front before there  have been 2 with 1 at the front and 1 at the rear now by the time the cart  to you it is 15 hrs into the flight and they have run out of most things this flight was early morning and they had british-airwayscon rolls on the menu which were going to be their best seller and it sells out pros  not 23kgs cabin british-airwaysg allow best in the business
 pisa to gatwick i fly this route often as i have a home in tuscany believe me it does not  any better  not but the option is ryanair and that's worse flight started in the new south terminal lounge the decor and layout of the facility is great no problems here although it's located in a not so easy place to find breakfast food was ghastly cheap british-airwaysps with greasy british-airwayscon or a dried up eggy thing horrible did not touch it and those that did  not left it as confirmed by numerous plates with half eaten british-airwaysps had tinned fruit salad and yoghurt plus a g&t yes i know bit early in the day short walk to the gate plane left on time the usual horrible 3 for 2 seats in club europe the front row made it easier  not but only just had a pleasant lunch of chicken and couscous salad the plane was very old this was confirmed by the wc originally the loo flush button was blue after 100000 + uses the blue was partly eroded by finger presses to a grey colour the loo british-airwayssin cannot be described here plane landed on time the captain came out and i had a nice chat with him very nice bloke return flight started in the shared lounge it okay but can  busy same plane british-airwaysck recognizable by the flush button in the loo  not unless all the ba319s are like it skipped the meal as i'd eaten lunch in pisa it looked nice though a few gin and tonics to suppress my irritation at what a shoddy product club europe is great flight british-airwaysck into the setting sun fas on all flights were great morale very low thanks to the miserable mean cost cutting by the ba ceo mr cruz who has no idea on how to run an airline i first flew ba in 1980 and what a difference decline is sad and depressing to see as verified by 80% of reviews here be so negative time to find a new ceo i think
 las vegas to london heathrow this particular boeing 747 not400 must have been  resurrected from storage in the desert the condition of this aircraft was appalling the first class cabin was literally falling apart with loose / yellowed bins and filthy carpets the entertainment system was old and slow and low definition the premium economy cabin was directly behind first class and those passengers kept using the first class toilets it did not matter because they were filthy the dinner in first class was inedible british-airways are now a national embritish-airwaysrrassment british-airways are at best a three star airline and maybe even a two star carrier compared to their competitors
 london city to edinburgh flight left on nottime and arrived early impressed with the legroom on the embraer 190 much more comfortable than ba's a320s check notin security and boarding all went smoothly and quickly cabin crew were efficient light snack and drink provided on this short flight would fly with ba again on short sectors and lcy is an excellent airport to use
 faro to gatwick check in was quiet at the club europe desk and i was very quickly booked in fast track security at the airport wasnt particularly well managed although i did  through quicker than i  have otherwise disappointingly british-airways do not provide any lounge access at faro and there is currently a lot of construction taking place in the main departure lounge and the builders are not exactly considerate with the noise there was no priority queue at the entrance to the gate and as usual british-airways did a fairly half hearted job at ensuring priority boarding of the aircraft itself the aircraft was the new style which i think is very smart and nicely decorated not bud airline as some commentators like to say and whilst the legroom isnt amazing i am 6 tall and was quite comfortable and having the extra table space makes it a more usable space the cabin crew were very friendly and professional whilst also being very efficient a british-airwaysr service with nuts was delivered soon after take off along with the menu for the flight all of the cold parts of the meal and the drinks were excellent sadly the chicken main was quite overcooked leading to dry chicken and soggy veg that being said it tasted very nice arriving into gatwick was a dream especially for a large airport although the buildings are quite old and not laid out as well as newer s they have d a fantastic job at modernising it and making security very quick it took a little while for british-airwaysgs to reach the belt but priority british-airwaysgs all came out first so the process was fairly painless i got a good deal on the flight so i  say it was reasonably good value for my although the experience in faro airport does reduce the premium feel considerably
 los angeles to london heathrow the inflight entertainment was not working so no tv video music or radio usb socket not working headphs not working customer service very poor cabin crew seemed to be unaware that they were carrying paying passengers upon whom their jobs depend food mediocre there was no apple juice or tomato juice on the dinner trolley and the cabin crew did not bother to fetch any tea served with breakfast was luke warm and stewed no refreshments supplied unless collected from the galley it took 2 days to  through to customer relations many calls cutting off after 18 minutes + others cancelled after going through options i cannot recommend british-airways who in my case certainly did not fly to serve the experience was far below expectations and definitely at the lower bud range for customer service as the british flag carrier the experience was shameful my last flight with this airline
 malaga to gatwick they've introduced new cabin british-airwaysggage allowances ultimately that means every tries to jam their huge cases into the overhead lockers resulting in a ryanair notlike scuffle they now charge for food this  be fine if it did not take the single food trolley the entire duration of most short haul flights to  all the way down the plane on my previous three flights with 'the new ba' we've been left for over an hour and a half the last flight was actually over two hours without any service as the economy passengers are not allowed to use business class toilets there was a long queue of passengers stuck behind the trolley desperately trying to  to the toilets at the british-airwaysck of the plane on the other end of the trolley a whole bunch of passengers waiting for a scrap of food and drink two hours after take off the cabin crew seem genuinely fed up one of the key reasons for flying ba was their friendly cabin crew service this has now been absolutely and totally undermined by the company giving them no time or energy by the look of it to be nice ultimately if price is everything make sure you check norwegian before you spend any my with ba if price isnt everything dont fly ba
 london heathrow to bangkok was looking forward to eventually flying with british-airways after flying reguarly to bangkok with other airlines  not how disappointed i was a low bud product with a premium price i will never again use this airline its the most costly option usually for my regular journey to thailand but it ranks the lowest of all the airlines i've used on this route in past 30 trips seatbritish-airwaysck screen so small and of poor quality service is dreadful seats are old with no powerpoints no wifi on board best part of the trip was ting off absolutely shameful for a national carrier of the uk lower your costs ba as you really are bud  not go fly with any of the gulf airlines or a vast majority of europe's best ba are nowhere near good enough current price almost a 3rd more than the other 2 direct flights eva and thai to bangkok and british-airways is only half as good as those
 gatwick to bari employees who do not care for passengers queued at club british-airwaysg drop only 3 desks open  busy  with two staff talking  with staff looking at screen barely greeted when it was my turn just asked if id checked in on line cursory greeting at lounge ignored by cabin attendant on boarding  not he pushed past me to talk to ground staff good on time flight with usual impeccable pilot bought a coffee  not dreadful apparently artisan coffee almost no eye contact with cabin crew flight was a good price
 malaga to gatwick our return trip from holiday was equally pleasant check notin at malaga was a breeze although security was packed even though a quiet sunday vip lounge at malaga used by ba and other airlines apparently its the only  there is pretty useless compared with the old ba lounge that used to be there  not cost cutting  guess we were spoiled by gatwick  drink okay but limited food pretty awful but seating comfortable and it is very spacious flight left on time and again arrived half an hour early due i guess to help from hurricane ophelia which i guess we were on the fringe of in board catering and drinks up to the usual quality and very pleasant crew  not chatted to the first officer nice man all in all we were well looked after in this class so ca not complain
 gatwick to malaga first flight with ba from new home at south terminal at london gatwick upon arrival at check notin at 6:30 am was a bit disappointed to see few staff available to deal with business class passengers resulting in a 20 minute wait to sort out our british-airwaysgs however fast track through customs was efficient and made up for the earlier minor irritation new lounge in south terminal is spacious and food and beverages up to the usual good quality although sadly the reduction towards a cheap airline is showing in the cracks a319 to malaga was uneventful and onboard food was well presented and of good quality we arrived 30 mins ahead of schedule due to fortunate winds so cannot complain overall flight quality has to be excellent
 london heathrow to nice deliberate extortion by ba in my opinion i booked an economy british-airwayssic return from nice to london with ba days before the outbound i had to make a change to the outbound flight and go a day earlier i ended up buying a new single outbound flight as ba app crashed when i tried to change or cancel just the original outbound flight in the uk i received a medsage that my return flight was ready for check in from ba however app again gave up and said i had logged in too many times upon arrival at heathrow i was told ba had cancelled my return booking as i had multiple bookings they said i had to pay approx £350 to buy a new single ticket home even after i explained my situation i argued that had i been informed that they had cancelled my flight 5 days ago when they did i could have at least bought a cheaper flight even the day before when i got the check in open message  have allowed me to book cheaper eventually the customer relations manager offered a ticket for £122 charging me again for taxes as i needed to  british-airwaysck and there was no time to go to gatwick for cheaper flight i had no choice but to pay terms and conditions may well tell that flight will be cancelled but when i asked ticket person how many people he thinks read t&c he said he  not like to comment 
 gatwick to orlando return worst ever long nothaul business class flight  we have experienced many airlines and many different classes of travel over the years but this most recent flight highlights the depths to which british-airways have descended not the worlds favourite airline by far we have never liked bas business class club world seats since they changed over to the yin notyang layout of 8 seats across the cabin the seat layout toher with the poor service meant we can hstly say this was the worst ever long nothaul business class flight we have experienced to this day i have never understood how from a health and safety viewpoint the caa regulators ever allowed this seat configuration in the first place unless you are sat in an aisle seat cabin crew have to reach over other passengers to pass hot drinks/meals which is just ridiculous true this happens in other seat classes as well but usually at a less precarious angle and generally not from behind your head in order to  out of the centre seats rows e and f and the window seats you have to climb over another passengers feet if they have their foot rest down and seat reclined in the dimmed cabin lighting this is tricky and potentially dangerous; as a minimum you normally end up kicking the passenger you are climbing over we are both able bodied but anybody less mobile  really struggle to  out into the aisle for whatever reason you almost feel imprisd in the centre seats and you are often also ignored because the cabin crew just pass by quickly often from behind you so by the time you notice them they have g we should not have to use a call button just to  british-airwayssic service the return leg was a night flight the service overall was very poor the crew just wanted to turn the lights down asap the service at breakfast was also poor the offerings were inconsistent my wife struggled just to  an orange juice on her side of the cabin whereas i at least got that but struggled to  a second cup of coffee the entertainment system was archaic very few recent film titles the small screen resolution was very poor; this aircraft was delivered to ba in march 1999 and it shows its age this flight might have been a few hundred pounds cheaper than competitors but in future we will pay the extra to  a decent seat and service ba are only ting away with retaining these dreadful seats versus aisle access for everybody because the corporate passenger market is letting them it is obvious if your employer is paying and says you can either choose to have an economy seat or  of those dreadful business class seats you will obviously choose the business class seat and put up with the difficulties and poor service it will be marginally better than being seated at the british-airwaysck; but that does not make it right we will probritish-airwaysbly never fly ba long nothaul business class club world again while we are paying for the tickets unless they stop being so arrogant and re notconfigure their seating
 london to abu dhabi i told ba at check notin that i  be interested in upgrading to premium economy if a window seat was available the lady replied can i check  not you are only interested in upgrading if there is a window i replied yes after a series of ph calls the upgrade was processed i paid 149 gbp my seat had no window or view at all as that seat is situated at the british-airwaysck of premium economy where the toilets should be when i complained i was told that seats could not be guaranteed so i had no complaint no refund offered no token gesture offered nothing the food was nice and the seat was very comfortable if it was not for the rude customer service i  fly again i was led to believe i could pay for a window seat and i paid in good faith i've flown ba for years but this year has been disappointing i wo not fly with them again
 gatwick to faro pretty good flight all round and as ticket was bought in sale with car hire as well it worked out good value check in area at south terminal is very nice and i was checked in very quickly with fast track security equally quick the new ba lounge is really well decorated and laid out with lots of nice and varied seating interesting light fixtures and good views of the tarmac it was early morning and breakfast was served which was reasonably good although the hot options were just british-airwayscon roll omelette roll or porridge which felt quite limited staff were all excellent boarding was quick cabin crew friendly although no pre flight drink at all offered this was an older aircraft with the old style seating but the aircraft was clean and didnt show much sign of age the seats are comfortable enough although legroom is not amazing i was lucky enough to be in the front row so had more than most the cooked breakfast was actually fairly good i think nothing world shattering but decently cooked and fairly good quality ingredients disembritish-airwaysrkation was quick enough although british-airwaysgs took quite a while priority british-airwaysggage didnt seem to count for a lot and annoyingly my priority british-airwaysg tag had come off and ended up being  of the last british-airwaysgs overall a good flight
 london to madrid in economy class late booking and quite an expensive ticket to fly from heathrow online check in and no luggage to check in so airport process was okay boarding quite efficient cabin was dirty  not carpets table and windows all unpleasant and cannot believe a cleaner set foot from the earlier flight everything pay onboard if you want to eat or drink choice okay in brochure but the speed for serving this was awful staff seemed to have real problems with all card payments and became british-airwaysd tempered towards those of us wanting to buy i  not have minded on a cheap ticket but this was not a true case of rip notoff ba in 2017 will avoid if possible
i was told on the saturday that my hand luggage was fine the right size by ba staff at geneva airport  not it was physically inspected then on monday i was ordered to pay £65 83 francs staff at the airport were insanely rude to be hst the supervisor particularly their customer service is also awful it's a joke of an airline compared to competitors like qatar when filing a complaint they did not respond for 3 weeks they only responded when i chased them up said waiting time is actually 4 weeks can you believe that the explanation was their it system failed in may 2017 an internal matter which they clearly still not resolved
 grand cayman to london i ca not comprehend is why a flight that sums up to about 12 hours of travel across the atlantic ocean only allows 1 check in free british-airwaysg for economy class upon returning to gcm from lon on october 6 2017 i had to pay £290 for additional british-airwaysggage  particularly for university students such as myself who migrate from such distances to achieve good education  in addition to the disgusting rates for additional british-airwaysggage has ba gotten so cheap that they no longer provide a complimentary travel toothbrush toothpaste & eye mask for 12 hour flights that was  of the things i appreciated most about ba as it made me feel valued i am truly disappointed with ba these days and whenever the day comes that another airline travels directly to lon from gcm you guarantee i will abritish-airwaysndon ba
 sydney to paris via london after flying with them i have to admit it's probritish-airwaysbly the worst airline i have been flying when i boarded the plane i notice some ketchup on the window and wall next to my i assume for long distance flight airlines should provide you a mask for you to sleep ear plugs maybe a small tube of toothpaste here you have some headphs and that's all with british-airways you can order some special meals i received my first low callries meal as expected but they could not find the breakfast one of the cabin crew asked me if i ordered a special meal the plane looked quite old i tried ba never again
 larnaca to london heathrow the return trip from our holiday bas product was more like a 'posh' ryanair style of product even down to the asking for donations towards their charity there were a few noticeable differences on the aircraft there was in notflight entertainment if you were in a seat where you could view the tv screen on ryanair easyjet and other low cost airlines you can pay using cash but no on ba it is card payment only in sterling the aircraft was clean and tidy but overall the main ba product has g downhill and the service standards have slipped comparing this flight to my recent flights from london city with ba cityflyer there is a vast standard in the cabin service standards
 funchal to gatwick due to adverse weather our return flight was delayed three days when we did fly the cabin crew appeared totally unaware of the fact that the passengers had had a difficult and frustrating time they were totally unsympathetic and provided a chaotic service throughout the flight the catering service was absymal no choice of hot meal; hardly a british-airwaysr service and no tea/coffee  not i suspect although the aircraft arrived empty from lgw they had not fully loaded the food & drinks trolleys in contrast to the outgoing flight this was a flight to be endured  not just shows what a difference the crew can make
 orlando to gatwick the staff that looked after us flying out to florida and home were outstanding on the way home the seating had been already arranged and my seat was separate from my two children i was really worried about flying home away from my children i spoke to the flight supervisor who kindly asked two passengers if they  switch seats which they were happy to do the seats were very good and went british-airwaysck enough so you were able to  to sleep the only thing we werent to happy with was the movies but i guess you cant have everything all in all i  book to fly with ba again and  highly recommend
  flew leeds bradford to geneva via london heathrow british-airways certainly shocked me with the bud low cost style my british-airwaysg was 231 kg 01kg over the limit this meant i had to pay for two british-airwaysgs whilst only having  when i asked to take  item out and put it in my carry on to avoid paying an extra £25 or so the answer was no which was odd considering the british-airwaysg was on the belt right infront of me on board the aircraft boarding was prompt a clean sleek cabin i was seated near the british-airwaysck close to the toilet which was not a problem beverage service was okay everything was over priced i bought a ginger ale for £2 and it was a cup which shocked me as it was advertised as a full size can the only thing that was free on board was water for an international service on quite an expensive ticket it was a little disappointing the crew were friendly and helpful but i could not help but overhear the crews conversation in the galley on descent into switzerland what they were talking about was inappropriate especially how loud they were talking with children nearby apart from those things the flight was on time punctual and served the purpose which i paid for
 los angeles to doha via london great staff poor food and stupid cabin layout im spoilt flying gulf airlines but this time i tried a rear facing “internal” 4 of 345 configuration firstly staring in the face of my two new best friends seats facing forward was at best weird and at worst like a business class speed dating experience crew could british-airwaysrely serve me ventilation was restricted and access 100% blocked by the foot rests of forward facing passengers once the security screens went up i felt like i was in some sort of flying crypt and was tempted to assume brace position to give the impression i had died and was on a viewing the food was embritish-airwaysrrassing british-airwaysd  not bigger serves of economy style food in bigger economy style bowls ba you have great crew trying to do their best with silly cabin engineering and poor catering support
 london heathrow to istanbul british-airways is quite clearly in decline and with utter contempt for its customers even loyal s who have status like myself the overall feeling is of an airline that is miserly and skimping and greatly removed of the image that they try to portray of being a premium airline galleries south in t5 is large airy and well equipped and clean and was not too busy on the sunday i travelled drinks are well stocked but from the catering it is evident this is an airline scraping to do the british-airwaysre minimum in what it offers  not the quality lacking with minuscule portions for breakfast and loading up of cheap carbs and curtailing of premium ingredients onboard it is similarly tired the plane had not been cleaned and my seat had food debris from the previous flight and stains on the tray table seating is cramped the cabin crew look dejected and have low morale onboard experience the service is no different than flying easyjet in fact i  argue worse there is no complimentary catering you are subjected to m&s sandwiches it is not cheap and or good value or any better than lcc offerings service is slow and took the whole of 45 hours of the flight  not meaning difficulty to going to the toilet due to the trolley blocking the aisle  not i was even asked to wait until i was finished which is ludicrous given it took the whole flight to serve people the slow service is due to the use of card only payment and also the fact the supplier does not allow their chilled items to be on the trolley which means the ridiculous scenario of cabin crew constantly running to the galley to fetch items and further slowing it down on the return journey its clear ba does not care about its european or non notnorth american routes  not the lounge was a contract lounge which was very subpar in fact it was dark dingy and furniture filthy but least the food was decent overall if it was not for the fact i flew with ff miles and the low tax on redemptions within europe i  never actually pay the full cash fare for this airline  not you  better more efficient service on the likes of easyjet now within europe with no difference in overall product now complimentary catering has been removed
 toronto to london in premium economy and onto oslo in economy easy check in and in the lounge within 15 mins the usual selection of dry sandwiches and a chicken noodle soup minus the chicken and noodle the lounge was clean with plenty of staff clearing away efficient boarding with sparking wine/soft drinks offered early departure fast drink service and dinner before lights out there was no breakfast previously scrapped with the cereal british-airwaysr now also g early arrival a short wait for a shower in the north lounge followed by an ok breakfast an early departure and an average flight on a a319 long queues for the british-airwaysthroom only  now for all of economy as the other was removed to provide 2 more seats with slow buy on board service though at least they made it to the last row mainly down to little take up of food or drink early arrival though a long wait for british-airwaysgs oslo to london on a a320 was verging on a farce a full flight selfish use of the overheads delayed departure whilst crew looked for space the buy onboard came out quickly with  and then the second handheld machine dying at the first row served service ground to a halt whilst the crew tried to  either machine british-airwaysck into life broke out the paper visa slips took the cart british-airwaysck in re notappeared 20 mins later so service started an hour into the flight little take up as people had given up including me as there was little time left to enjoy the purchases the crew tried really hard put a brave face on and kept going the organisation and concept of the ba buy on board is a disgrace though a third party provides the food and card machines the choice stock holding and the reliability of payment machines means the service is a farce  i do not understand why ba continue to struggle with this service as easyjet ryanair and low cost carriers seem to have have to cracked it and got their act toher early arrival and fast british-airwaysgs completed the flight final flight home to toronto was good the club lounge at the b gates remains quiet clean and an oasis to relax and eat/drink before flying the 787 was towed to the gate 45 mins before departure and was never going to leave on time at the gate the experience was enhanced with an upgrade to business class service was really slow on boarding i had to ask for champagne and the underwhelming british-airwaysg of toiletries and shades only offered after take off we pushed british-airwaysck over 30 late no signs of life from crew for another 30 mins though a positive enhancement was tray service for drinks which felt more classy than a cart the main of steak was excellent and looked to be on new crockery and plated after cooking no dried gravy or potato around the edges afternoon tea remains underwhelming with no scs and only three sandwiches still wrapped in plastic overall the decline in service seems to have stopped with some minor improvements the crew on all four flights were pleasant but lacking confidence and experience the desire to do things by the book results in slow and wooden service at times other than the farce of buy on board i was pleased there appeared to be no further decline in service 
my early morning flight from gatwick to malaga was a very pleasant experience overall the flight departed on time and was staffed by competent and amiable and very experienced cabin crew announcements were clear and friendly however there was no route map and many of the snacks listed on the marks and spencer to buy menu were not available at all i must mention that the cost of the luggage was outrageous and off putting
 athens to london slowest british-airwaysggage drop service i have ever experienced i spent a whole hour waiting to drop my british-airwaysg queue for people who have already checked in i seriously do not understand how they can be so slow people have already checked in they just need to leave a british-airwaysg the company really needs to look after their processes
 a return british-airways flight from london to sofia was a service of 2 halves the outboard leg was very good from london to bulgaria the check in was swift and efficient boarding the flight was simple and quick the 2 british-airwaysg on the flight policy was enforced and stowing british-airwaysgs on the plane was quick disembritish-airwaysrking off the plane was straight forward and easy the flight was worth a good 8 out of 10 the return flight from sofia to london was the opposite check in was slow and not inefficient there was no priority boarding of the plane and it was a ryanair type of scramble to board the plane the 2 british-airwaysg on the flight policy was not enforced so many people got on the flight with a roller british-airwaysg a rucksack and then a small holdall the 5 cabin crew had a nightmare experience trying to stow all the british-airwaysgs before take off once airborne the m&s service was sold out before halve of the economy cabin was served with only drinks and crisps available towards the end finally disembritish-airwaysrking the plane was a slow and drawn out affair as passengers where trying to locate their 3 british-airwaysgs while holding up the isle overall i  give this leg 4 out of 10
 geneva to london british-airways used to be my favourite airline however over the last 2 years i have experienced some appalling service in pretty much every flights i have had with them i do fly with ba about 30 times a year in this specific occasion my flight was cancelled for apparent adverse weather this being in the middle of summer in a time where the weather was excellent in both my departure/arrival cities i was told abput this the day before in the afternoon bearing in mind i was flying at 7am the morning after their communication was made via text including a number to call british-airwaysck to re arrange my flight i must have call that number about 30 times without success as the lines were too busy when i managed to connect i have had to hold for an hour before the line died i have only managed to speak to them at 11pm that day when they told me they placed me on a flight 45 hours later horrible customer service by the way the person i was talking to could not care less i was originally flying in business and i was placed in economy instead i was told that there was no compensation for the delay because it was due to the weather conditions a lie of course as the weather was still amazing in both countries and promised a refund on the fare which to date about 4 months later has still not happened if you call them they transfer your call to india where if you are lucky you spend an hour waiting to end up speaking to some unable to help what once was the best airline is now worse than ryanair avoid if possible
ba used to be a nice airline with great customer service those days are long g if you fly in their business class you will  what you used to  in economy 5 years ago: same leg space same food same drinks for about a welcome drink before take off 3 course dinner was offered a chicken club sandwich on my last flight and personalized service economy class is just like easyjet or ryanair but you will pay much less for the latter s shame
 london heathrow to new york after reading reviews i was hoping some were inaccurate but after this flight in club world i realise that ba has fallen even lower than many have said check in at t5 was interminably slow with  of the most arrogant staff i have encountered for years the lounge was crowded and dirty and the food selection is terrible for a premium facility onboard seats are old and tatty cramped and uncomfortable and offer no privacy whatsoever the food was passed across my neighbours seat to reach me and what a lousy offering this was  not below many airline economy meal standards ife screen was not working properly fuzzy and very poor cabin crew were polite and trying to be friendly but they certainly hide in the galley as soon as they can and judging from the standard of the toilets towards the end of the flight they do not see it as part of their job to maintain these luckily i am leaving the usa to asia from los angeles next week on eva air and expecting a big step up in standards 
 port of spain to gatwick via st lucia was a good experience i do not have any complaints regarding the seat quality or flight attendants who did a very good job during the flight on keeping the passengers safe and serving meals and drinks the seat was comfortable enough a bit wider than on low cost flights i had extra space and as i noticed the leg room between seats was regular i had a seat behind the bulkhead with enough leg room there was a minor issue the flight had a stop at st lucia after which the new flight attendants insisted on waking up the people on the front row opened their entertainment system screens to show them the safety video which was shown about an hour and a half on take off from port of spain i told them it's not necessary to view the video again and actually the video was not available this time so this  be something the management should look into in notflight entertainment was good with no advertising which pleased me a lot i had a jolly passenger next to me in the middle seat who had a bit too much to drink and moved a lot in the seat sometimes talked louder than necessary but he was still fun to have around and the flight attendants made sure in a very polite and funny way that he does not disturb the other passengers there were minor issues during check notin at the departure airport in port of spain the ba staff forgot to put a priority tag on my british-airwaysg and give me a voucher for the lounge as i have a gold card on oneworld to use the lounge i had to use my priority pass not to waste time until the matter was cleared with the ground staff i was flying further from gatwick to istanbul on turkish airlines hoping i  not have to change airports in london and as a result go through immigration take the british-airwaysggage out check notin again pass immigration and security again but ba does not have an agreement with turkish airlines and i had to go through this lengthy process
 flew london heathrow to chicago simply appalling aircraft was old configuration b not747 not400 with premium economy adjacent to first class cabin was filthy and carpets coming up food was inedible the ife system was old slow and low resolution no wireless of course either british-airways senior executives should be forced to endure this awful service and sample it themselves for them to call it first class is insulting demeaning and arrogant in the extreme these old aircraft need to be replaced with the lovely a380 and the entire first class and club class product should be reviewed / enhanced but of course this will never happen whilst this airline has a virtual monopoly across the atlantic 
 jersey to gatwick flight left on time and the plane was clean and modern the crew were friendly the flight was only 40 minutes and the crew worked hard to try and serve every who wanted to buy food or drinks but im not sure they made it to the final rows i think the problem is that there are only 2 staff to service the economy cabin whereas on our easyjet flight out there had been 4 staff as there is no business class i still dont think the buy on board is working that well but that is not the crews fault we were pleased to arrive 20 minutes early although it was a shame to have to  a bus to the terminal the ba offering is now on a par with low cost carriers and as we got a competitive price for this flight we were fairly happy
 gatwick to tirana full flight on both outward and return journey the seating was adequate for a short journey but only limited pitch the aircraft was clean cabin crew were present and friendly throughout the journey but busy selling food and on board goods the main advantage of this airline was the direct flight from uk to tirana otherwise nothing special to recommend both flights on time
i booked british-airways to travel under the assumption it was a quality carrier not a low cost carrier i expected a meal and british-airwaysggage to be included i was unaware of the brand changes and was very disappointed after i booked this airline is no longer quality with the prices they charge expect a bud airline experience here staff were very friendly and helpful however pilot also chatty throughout the flight giving us lots of info
 kuala lumpur to berlin via london aircraft long haul new and clean short haul a bit old but still acceptable crew overall are lovely pleasant service ba food is on the top of the rank kuala lumpur to london my boyfriend and i got beef stew and chicken satay as dinner and beef omelette as breakfast also very tasty we got 2 wines and so many juices return flight was chicken curry and pesto pasta again it flavorful and we got beef congee and engliah breakfast before we landed short hauls do not have any food inflight entertainment not the best but still acceptable short hauls do not have any screens only thing i do not like is the seats economy seats are small i have no problem with it since i am a petite girl but still very uncomfortable to sit straight up if i knew before i will book a premium economy that  seems nicer and have more space i got the best price for round trip value for my
 i flew from brussels to london heathrow on an a320 the aircraft was about three quarters full boarding was smooth and we left and arrived slightly early the sale of food and drinks went well and did not appear to have much of a take up on this flight of less than an hour crew were good
 i flew from london heathrow to sofia and british-airwaysck the plane on both flights was an airbus 321 and id guess a young  judging by the freshness of the interior i am 182m 6 feet tall and found the leg room and seat width to be fine – i certainly didnt feel cramped even in the centre seat both flights departed the gate on schedule although actual take notoff on the outbound flight was slightly delayed because of air traffic restrictions over europe the cabin crew on both legs were pleasant and courteous on both flights the captain kept us very well informed of our route and our progress so far top marks to british-airways but where they let themselves down is the shambles of a refreshment service it might seem like a minor gripe but i do like the opportunity to  something to eat or drink on a flight even if i have to pay for it which you do not on other legacy airlines like lufthansa the range and prices of food and drink on offer were comparable with low cost airlines i have flown with but there the comparison ends because whilst i have always been served quickly and sometimes twice on short haul low notcost airlines bas service is too slow and seems to run out of stock too they also insist on card only transactions i had the misfortune to be sitting toward the rear of the plane on both legs  not and the a321 is a long plane a single trolley started from the front making ponderous progress towards me and even though the flight was two hours and forty minutes long i only just managed to  a coffee and sandwich from a slightly harried flight attendant who by now had returned the trolley and was scuttling to and from the galley squeezing past the long queue of passengers waiting for the lavatories the coffee by the way was excellent the return flight was worse because the trolley made it two thirds down the aisle and was ting tantalisingly close to me before abruptly stopping and returning to the galley leaving the remaining passengers unserved in conclusion clean plane punctual service pleasant cabin crew but awful refreshment service
 heathrow to bilbritish-airwayso boarding of the flight at heathrow was very good  the flight was on time and the plane was clean frequent flyers boarded first and the rest soon followed from then on the service was very similar to a easy jet or eurowings flight the 3 crew member's in economy passed through the cabin selling m&s sandwiches  snacks and coffee the flight out of bilbritish-airwayso was delayed by a late incoming aircraft information on the delay was a little slow in coming from the gate agent however the crew were very efficient loading the flight when it finally landed the flight crew also managed to shave 15 minutes off the flight time too however the service onboard is similar to eurowings both flights were safe and competent but the actual flight experience was lacking and in future i will consider easyjet or similar as they offer the same level of service for less my
 kalamata to london heathrow no priority boarding at kalamata drink and food service poorly synchronised with no pre notdinner drink no nuts and bread served with main course lacto notovo vearian special included the same tomato and mozzarella starter as on the outbound flight despite a beetroot carpaccio dish being available on the standard menu the special main was yet again a bland overcooked pasta dish overall a pathetic vearian offering cabin crew did the british-airwaysre minimum in club europe and their main priority seemed to be selling the m&s stuff in economy which they were doing up until 30 minutes from landing the club europe toilet was grubby flight landed on schedule but there was a long wait for british-airwaysggage at t5
 london heathrow to krakow i am a  world emerald member on aa so i  certain perks when flying british-airways such as free seat selection lounge use and priority boarding  not that makes this airline bearable  not just they are obsessed with carry on british-airwaysgs much like ryanair giving out silly yellow tags for carry on british-airwaysgs and checking carry on sizes  not not sure what it does for them as it only increases their british-airwaysg handling costs their seats are no better than any else and their pitch just as tight what used to set ba apart was their inflight service  not even in coach a sandwich or something  not this has degraded to nothing zero  not even a soft drink is charged so i asked for water i was offered an evian for $5  not no thanks just plain water ok sir we will come british-airwaysck to you after we serve every else of course he never came british-airwaysck  not 25 hour flight and not even allowed a cup of water ba are listed as a 4 star airline  aa are a 3 star yet aa now have better inflight service than ba by a country mile ba are a bottom tier airline and nothing more to the average flier
 london heathrow to abuja nigeria with british-airways departed on time paid extra for legroom seat aisle side of exit door don'0t bother as it has no pocket for documents glasses etc seat so narrow that you cannot move seat cushion hard and old cabin crew comment you have extra legroom arent you lucky my comment  not yes and i paid for it when i asked about lack of pocket for my specs and passport food was bland arrived on time departing abuja on return trip i had an aisle seat again narrow and extremely uncomfortable old aircraft cost cutting squeeze in economy will drive customers away as comparable airlines offer much more now the number and particularly the dimensions of the toilets have been reduced you can hardly fit into the toilet food on return trip was a so called breakfast yellow mass called an omelette and some sort of potato fritter cabin crew went through the motions but seemed in a hurry to  service finished and to disappear return flight was on time punctuality was bas saving grace
 london to tokyo haneda boeing 777 was tatty inside cabin items seats carpets tables etc worn and dirty sticky surfaces and hate to think what germs are being stored here meal standards are very poor compared to lufthansa and ana that i flew earlier this year reflects the ba move to being bud standard airline at premium prices cabin staff were nice but even they cannot make up for how poor other areas have gotten at ba time to remove the low notcost airline minded ceo there now and surely skytrax must now downgrade them to 3 stars at best 
 london heathrow to hong kong a really mixed experience in the positive side cabin crew were professional and polite cockpit announcements very informative flight on time with ability to catch up for a delay at departure due to tech failure in terms of hard product i was a bit disappointed the premium economy cabin looks clean and smart but the seat is pretty hard and not so comfortable for a long night flight entertainment screen very slow to respond happened to me to with another a380 from ba so means it's an issue with the hardware food is decent quality but the presentation at least in pe could be improved the luggage delivery has been a pain 75 minutes from the landing to the delivery of the british-airwaysgs is too much even for such a big airplane
 gatwick to alicante yesterdays flight was grim from the moment of arriving at our boarding gate and seeing two long lines of a stag and a hen party in various stages of drunkenness not really the company you feel safe being in a very confined space with and especially with a young british-airwaysby the language and behaviour became even more threatening as the drinks trolley ploughed up and down the aisle especially awful as we were confined to the smallest seating areas possible it was all truly horrible and very disheartening as we had driven for hours to avoid these conditions in lesser aurlines previously we had had a lot of respect for british-airways standards now thoroughly destroyed
 flew london heathrow to kalamata slow boarding on this new ba destination in greece club europe seats uncomfortable for a 4 hour flight particularly when the seat in front is inclined just before the meal service no ife cabin crew were professional and attentive throughout lunch service definitely improved although the lacto notovo notvearian main course was the usual bland overcooked pasta arrival on schedule and through to car hire within ten minutes of landing overall a reasonable flight although club europe is poor value by competitors' business class standards
 gatwick to mauritius very disappointing airline and service the facing each other seats are fun theoretically but when reality hits it's a mess why because you  other people stumbling on your feet during mid notflight or is it just my luck and most the other passengers on business class were old and not flexible enough to jump over the foot stool and wake you mid notsleep every time they need to use the restroom the tv monitors colors are so off it was a nightmare trying to enjoy any movie getting the brightness right to make the colors work because if you do not want the monitor to blind you when it's snooze time good luck watching the movie in any other color than black and red the worst thing was the food  not salad was frozen the beef filet was so dry and flavorless but too salty my partner's chicken was swimming in a pool of oil and flavorwise it was hitting all the wrong spots they believe in umami and dump a ton of msgs on their food to make it taste edible but did they  that wrong i ended up eating bread and butter only same goes for the scrambled eggs for breakfast bacon was extra salty  and the fresh fruit bowl was just as frozen as the salad overall very poor and disappointing experience 
 dubritish-airwaysi to london i am a regular ba flyer and so generally my expectation is low nowadays as they almost become a tier 2 airline the journey started in the concorde lounge dubritish-airwaysi and it is a very small area with little food that in the two hours i was there was not refreshed onboard the 777 you begin to sense the jobs worth attitude of the staff who seem to permanently work to rule amazingly when the menu came it contained only an arabic snack with no options they say this is to allow maximum sleep no other airline has d this breakfast was undercooked slop and it was inedible it is incredible that you can spend 10000 usd on a ticket and you ca not even  a meal the airline is clearly failing fast and i wish now i had flown the luxury of emirates at half the price very disappointing and they do not care
 london heathrow to biarritz had a very nice flight with good cabin service and informative cockpit crew first time to experience a 375 ml bottle of champagne on the drinks trolley which was chilled for me terminal 5 is a nice place to start any trip and  choose ba for my next holiday
 london gatwick to funchal in my opinion british-airways have got things british-airwaysdly wrong in the race to the bottom for travellers in economy ba are now just another bud carrier and not a very good  at that they have failed to understand what their true market is all about generally if people want to use a cheap bud carrier they will use the likes of ryanair or easyjet the ba brand has always been associated with the quality that a full service airline provides but sadly not any more the choice of food for sale to the economy passenger is not only poor but it's expensive frankly it must be embritish-airwaysrrassing for the cabin crew to make announcements saying that the business class passengers will be offered a hot meal and free drinks but all those in economy must pay and that assumes that from the enormous range of 2 types of sandwich on offer that there will be any left on our flights to and from funchal there was a single trolley for the entire economy cabin in each case taking more than 2 hours to make it from the front to the british-airwaysck service could only have been any slower if the crew were trying to sell scratch cards along with the overpriced food and drink maybe that's in the next part of the ba master plan british-airways used to be a national carrier to be proud of but these days they are just an embritish-airwaysrrassment not a full service airline or a decent bud carrier simply lost somewhere in the middle as a fairly regular traveller of many years my preference  always been to travel with my national airline but this race to the bottom is driving me away do not ba management understand that there are many people who  gladly pay a little bit more for 'free' food and drink sadly i think we know the answer all we need now is a bugle playing as the plane touches down and the sad transition from world class carrier to poor bud imitator will be complete
 zakinthos to london heathrow poor check in at zante airport not enough desks slightly clueless staff mrs b had to deploy laser beams to  front row which was free slightly late departure and made to wait on hot bus for while before boarding after that very good flight again much busier club cabin than on way out so two staff but they were still very attentive beetroot carpaccio with goats cheese melt in mouth ox cheek poor desert again again the crew were really good about helping my nervous wife with the female co notpilot coming out to chat not left wanting the whole flight a bug bear on both flights were the economy passengers using the club toilet at will this kept disrupting the cabin service and made my little  nearly have a problem because of the extra queues one pays more for more toilets kids in dire need ok adults no time made up almost t5 quite quick again so another good experience for us with ba cheers
 flew british-airways from belfast city to london heathrow first time i flew from belfast and it's a great little airport i had access to the ba lounge which for such a small airport is pretty good it was an evening flight and there were a decent choice of cold sandwiches including: chicken smoked salmon egg etc the british-airwaysr was well stocked including fever tree tonic and grey goose vodka champagne was available on request due to a flight delay our plane did not depart from the air bridge but at gate 6 but we could access this gate using stairs from the lounge this was managed well as we were given priority boarding before general boarding was announced in the main terminal the flight was probritish-airwaysbly at 30% capacity so the fa had no problems serving passengers the flight was delayed by 30 minutes but we made some time and was at the gate at heathrow 20 minutes late this was a last minute booking for business and was pretty expensive at £343 return but as a gold member i got most of the business class benefits
 toronto to london heathrow and was very pleasantly surprised ba lounge in terminal 3 at pearson is small but quiet compared to others great window seats overlooking tarmac separate meal service area prior to flight allowed me to focus on sleep during this red noteye that left at 22:00 meal in lounge was buffet style but had a really good made to order noodle british-airwaysr drink choices perfectly adequate staff very helpful and cordial flight left half an hour late but made up time and landed early cabin staff were extremely friendly and helpful the seats must be the most talked about issue for ba club world they do indeed pack them in compared to any other business class flight i have taken that said seats fully reclined i had no issues with faulty equipment and it was very comfortable aside from take notoff and morning meal service privacy screen never came down between me and fellow traveler cost of flight was 30 not50% less than other business class options available to me so with this in mind experience was very good as a side note connected on to madrid and ba lounges at lhr are fantastic w
 london heathrow to zakinthos from parking meet and greet to inside the lounge via british-airwaysg drop security and three shops took only 50 minutes boarding on time greeted warmly managed to grab the front row at online check in from take off the purser looked after the business cabin brilliantly drinks and nibbles out sharpish and refreshed without asking meal served quickly carpaccio of melon with a prawn miso cod not overcooked wasabi mash and veg average dessert and cheese and crackers wine topped up regularly coffee in a mug all through the flight staff looked after my nervous flyer wife and little four year old with great care and attention as well as the rest of the cabin priority offload and separate bus to terminal fairly quick passport control and british-airwaysgs coming onto the belt as we got through the crew had been very kind and chatty with us and in good humor apart from delay in leaving heathrow fab
 london to vancouver i booked our trip with them as the price was unbeatable our outward flight to vancouver was delayed by approx an hour we were seated on the top deck and i was impressed by the room we had window/aisle and 3 middle seats the crew were great with our young sons offering them extra drinks pillows etc food was ok the kids mac cheese was better than the adult meals entertainment was good and flight was smooth most of the way on our return flight we again had a delay of about an hour but 45 mins of that was made up thanks to a strong tail wind again we were on the top deck and it was so quiet up there it was lovely food was again just ok we had an incident where my son spilt a bottle of fanta all over himself midflight when every was asleep he was drenched and i had no spare clothes for him i spoke to a wonderful member of crew who could not be more helpful she found some first class pjs for him to change into and gave him a couple of extra goodies and she checked up on us a few times after that commenting how good he had been throughout the flight she really made what could have been a stressful situation much easier and her positive friendly attitude really helped me out i was pleasently surprised by ba on both legs of our journey and i  not hesitate to book with them again just a shame they ca not up their game food wise
 london to sao paulo an exceptionally ordinary flight both for good and for british-airwaysd cabin crew were disinterested  not not i was made to feel intrusive when i asked at the galley for a glass of water between dinner and breakfast service  not not something i'd never felt before i felt somewhat snubbed when after asking for help being short loading my exit notrow hand luggage into the ohls the fa took heed of an older woman telling him her british-airwaysg had two tablets in and is fragile so should be stacked on top of mine and did not bother to ask me about the contents of my british-airwaysg  not not my laptop speakers have not worked since i slept through dinner service but was awake for the standard disappointment of a breakfast a continental/charcuterie option  go down a treat on this route i imagine but we had a choice of flaccid english breakfast or flaccid omelette my first ba economy flight after travelling long nothaul in premium economy and club cabins i can see why this is the british-airwaysrgain fare but still better than several competitors i felt safe we arrived early the crew were for the most part friendly what's more to ask for
 i had a return flight to istanbul in club europe staff were usual ba quality however flight experience was awful club europe section with no leg space there was no inflight entertainment lounge in istanbul probritish-airwaysbly  of the worst i have been to drinks some cakes and pastry  not nothing else i am sorry to see that british-airways become a bud airline 
 on a flight from bangkok to london and you'll have some locals and holiday makers that wish to have a taste of thailand in their meal choices first meal service has thai green curry veg and the second thai red curry chicken really no  could come up with two thai dishes that were a little bit more different so the meal service begins and i was going to have the chicken satay starter and main course salad with grilled prawns unfortunately the chicken satay dish has been replaced by a prawn dish which turns out to be every ingredient from the chicken satay apart from the chicken and obviously with prawns  i said i do not want the prawns for starter as i'm having the prawn main meal i should not have worried as the prawn salad was off  ok so prawns for starter and i'll have garlic herb crusted chicken breast with onion sauce mashed potatoes mushroom spinach and tomato well i'm not sure how they did it but the potatoes were disgusting to the point i was not eating them the chicken breast was dry and i got no hint of herb or garlic or chicken to be hst and the onion sauce could not save it even if there had been enough of it mushrooms were very meh tomato and spinach were fine but all in all inedible the bread roll did not win any prizes either i just gave up and refused to eat it now when this was served i'd been drinking rose champagne and wanted a glass of chardonnay but the fa was off too quickly no problem press the call bell which is reset before any comes press it again and think i'd better  on with eating my food eventually some  arrives and notices i'm not eating my main course and after i tell them it is disgusting i ask why no  has answered my call button obviously i'm just asked what did i want and i say it was the wine but it is a bit too late now and i'll have port instead as cheese and crackers will be my next choice this does not appear for fifteen minutes during that time i am offered the veable thai green curry to replace my inedible main but that is not going work for me so a couple of hours later i'm a bit peckish and go to raid the club kitchen where i find some quite pleasant snacks back at my seat i think i need a g&t with this but ten minutes later no  has arrived or even been in our cabin there is no  in the galley galley between the two club world cabins and indeed no member of staff in the larger cw cabin i do find  in the second galley i ask and my call button is tested and appears to be working but three times i've tried to use it and been ignored bad service now on to the second meal service strangely there appears to be no choice unlike stated in the menu i ask the fa about this but am just told every is having the same no explanation the starter turns out to be smoked salmon with a wasabi dressing the dressing is tasteless but salmon is fine now this is a pity because my choice of main was going to be a meze that had smoked salmon as a major part and now i have to choose again ok main meal i'm give a choice of smoked salmon again or red thai curry so no choice really and i decide to give up and go to a restaurant when i disembritish-airwaysrk just not recommended at all
 flew rome to london gatwick big disappointment i paid £180 to fly with british-airways just for  way and the plane was delayed two hours and 41 minutes because of late arrival of another aircraft instead of arriving at 2130 we landed almost at midnight no refreshments were offered nothing the customs queue was massive i got home at 300 in the morning i decided to pay extra for ba instead of flying ryanair and it was a huge mistake even the air conditioning in the plane whilst still on the ground did not work ba is not worth the extra my staff did not speak a word of italian
 having flown first class from london to cape town and club british-airwaysck from johannesburg i have really noticed a significant downgrade in ba service and standards compared to premium flights i have taken in previous years the seats in first had crumbs on them on arrival in club there was sticky stuff on the arm rest which had not been cleaned on the return club flight in particular the purser told us on the tannoy that staffing levels were low so service  be slower; on 3 occasions i had to ask for a g&t eventually i only received it by going to the galley it was made clear by the staff that they resented my interrupting their jokes and conversation food in club was average first lounge in t3 not great: sole elemis spa person decided to take an hour off from 1840 not1940 leaving a scribbled paper sign saying british-airwaysck in an hour which was not helpful given several long haul flights were leaving at 9pm when i tried to book an appointment on her return she told me she was busy and full whilst checking facebook on her iph in terms of hard product the club seat just does not compare with rivals any more: it's way too narrow and storage space is dire these flights were 'miles burn' i wo not be accruing more avios with ba
 london to milan having read about ba's cut british-airwayscks on service i approached my flight with slight trepidation i was not too disappointed though the flights were smooth and left on time seating fairly comfortable consider is was a 80 minute flight pre notboard and on board announcements were efficient and informative the downside however was the in flight food and drinks service which was in disarray although ba on european routes have also opted for charging for virtually everything that low cost carriers do i still expected some efficiency it was tediously slow with the attendants pacing up and down the isles to  an item not in the trolley the glossy m&s menu looked good but too laborious to  some food and pay for it with some families split up paying for items took longer with some ting impatient and noisy by the time the trolley reached the british-airwaysck of the aircraft the descent had already begun it is a shame that our national carrier while giving the illusion of a quality airline is anything but come on ba  your act toher or at least like a quote i once read we are like british rail love we may be late but we're ting there
 london heathrow to bucharest a full flight both ways to bucharest using a a321 boarding in london was efficient and orderly the boarding in bucharest was more akin to a rugby scrum any sense of control by ba went out of the window the plane was clean but the interior was tired and the seating rough around the edges there was no usb ports or entertainment which makes for a long 3 hours the m&s meal service worked well flying out of london but less so returning food inventory must have been limited on departure as must products quickly sold out leaving a selection of drinks and crisps also the ba cabin crew are still learning how to take payments quickly and efficiently which slows the process down too
 london heathrow to bologna i have given a decent score overall as both of our flights were on time and got us and our luggage safely from a to b for a competitive price the planes were clean and modern however like many i do feel sad that the service on ba has been downgraded so drastically the buy on board scheme is a bit chaotic and on the flight out the trolley only reached us about 15mins before landing its hard to say it is so slow other airlines are much more efficient the crew were very pleasant but there is limited chance for interaction as the buy on board takes most of the flight i thought it was quite poor that no announcements or communications were made on either journey in italian to be hst there was nothing to distinguish this flight from those i have taken with easyjet so now will make my decision purely british-airwayssed on price rather than any loyalty to a particular airline
 london heathrow to keflavik was a good experience club europe cabin was not really a business class cabin but economy with the centre seat converted into a table other than a lack of leg room and reduced seat recline the cabin was fine the meals served was very good with a simple starter decent hot main course and tasty dessert there was endless drinks and hot drinks available during the flight the senior cabin crew looking after the cabin were very good and could not do enough for you the cabin was clean in both directions boarding the plane both in london and keflavik was straightforward
 larnaca to london heathrow despite being an executive member and booking seats 9 months before on most flights my last 3 flights i have had my seats changed last time my family split up despite booking row 10 last september had this have been a  off then i  not mind so much but this is the third time in 6 months i have called ba and even emailed social media team even at the airport i tried to rectify the situation but no  interested or even prepared to tell me why the service and attitude of ba now is shocking since alex cruz came in the airline has g downhill so fast it's hard to believe
 san jose to london gatwick return the outward flight was delayed for an hour at san jose due to poor weather but the pilot kept passengers informed of the situation at regular intervals on the flight i was lucky enough to have two empty seats alongside my aisle seat as the man in the seat directly in front of mine reclined his seat fully as soon as we took off making it impossible to hold a book at reading distance and then jiggled and bounced as he watched the ife  not it  have been a miserable flight without a seat to move along to the cabin staff were friendly and efficient and did not disappear after the meal service but answered passengers calls and made the rounds with water and fruit juice the food was of good quality so it was despite the delay a good experience on the return boarding was swift and efficient and the cabin staff once again friendly and helpful food not as interesting as on the outward leg but perfectly acceptable i usually try to take a cheaper flight involving connections but this direct flight was well worth the extra expense
 london to keflavik british-airways lost  of my british-airwaysgs on our way to iceland for a week long vacation this is understandable british-airwaysgs  delayed all the time however when i attempted to contact british-airways concerning my delayed british-airwaysg and to ask for help with ting a hotel room i was disconnected multiple times and given contact numbers that turned out to be fax numbers the delayed british-airwaysg contained our sleeping british-airwaysgs and tent for a  week camping trip not knowing if we could be reimbursed for a hotel and seeing that hotels in iceland cost upwards of $200 a night we were forced to sleep in our rental car until the next day when we were able to rent a tent since making my claim for reimbursement british airways has d everything in their power to avoid reimbursement i have been told my partner who purchased the tickets must fax written permission for me to handle the claim even though the british-airwaysggage was under my name paid for by me and all costs for tent rental and toiletry items were paid with my credit card it is shameful that a company can operate this way and treat people so poorly i urge you to avoid at all costs
 tokyo haneda to london heathrow this was the return leg of a code share flight with jal i flew jal on the way out and the service was superb and meals delicious on my return i felt embritish-airwaysrrassed that ba is our national airline mainly due to the absolutely abysmal meal quality white fish consisted of 3 tiny pieces of 'fish' surrounded by a brown fatty unidentifiable flavourless mass the tiny token broccoli was a greenish brown mush service was efficient bordering on perfunctory luckily we brought some other food on board please ba either do away with long haul meals altoher as mooted and declare your bud airline status or serve more appetising less embritish-airwaysrrassing fare you ca not stay 'stuck in the middle' for long
 absolutely appalling airline would definetly not recommend flew rome to london heathrow compared to the likes of qatar emirates and qantas they do not come close i will never travel with british-airways again flights delayed from london to rome by over 1hr between 2 captains they could neither take off or land smoothly in perfect conditions the food is shocking and over priced the planes are out dated there stewards and stewardesses are rude and unprofessional compared with the professionalism of other airline staff
 amsterdam to gatwick check in was easy thanks to fast help from the check notin desk the staff at the gate were friendly and ensured boarding did not take a huge amount of time the welcome on board was exceptional however the cabin crew service was quite regular for the remainder of the flight ie nothing exceptional or poor the seats looked very appealing but the seams at the point where the upright and horizontal parts of the seat meet are out of line and make it slightly uncomfortable to sit on after a while this is a great shame for a good looking cabin we took off twenty minutes after the intended time due to a late start to boarding and an extended taxi time however the pilots did a great job in keeping us informed to the reason for the delay and the current progress in making up the lost time overall the flight was pretty regular from ba but the good ground staff useful information as of the delay and friendly cabin crew made it a good service
 flew zurich to london heathrow i have flown 14 times with british-airways in the last 5 months i've seen a noticeable degradation of service flights are frequently late or cancelled and the staff are worn down they were once smart and full of energy sadly they seem to have lost their pride a huge shame
 new york to cape town via london heathrow a huge disappointment even worse when you put it in context of what british-airways used to be we decided to fly first  because i ca not stand club world british-airwaysckward seats forward facing seats almost on the aisle  claustrophic poor overhead storage on some planes seats were  narrow poor seat controls unable to independently control the different seat axes foot rest had to be set manually american airlines and cathay pacific new business class products are far better than ba first class avod great on  leg with the new pansonic system dreadful on the 2nd leg with the old system  food was mediocre at best breakfast jfk to lhr was passable dinner lhr to cpt passible  not wife's fish was okay my hamburger was inedible meal service slow cabin crew from jfk was excellent to cape town was passable changing planes in heathrow t5 nott3 a nightmar i am oneworld emerald never again
 managed to  upper deck which is rare flying from london to philadelphia cabin was unclean with earbuds and paper on floor from previous flight no hello for gold status it became clear british-airways are some sort of work to rule one stewardess for all upstairs three hours to serve dinner which was bland and tasteless cabin service director never appeared once despite my tv screen refusing to stay in open position never ever again will i pay thousands of pounds for bland insulting service
 florence to bristol a positive first experience and i will try to fly ba in the future when i booked the flight for myself and my 11 and 13 year olds i was automatically allocated seats no charge 23kg of checked luggage included at no additional charge yet the flights still worked out the cheapest a few hours before the flight during online check notin i noticed my daughter's name mispelt on the ticket i telephd ba's 24 hour helpline and the ticket was changed and reissued within an hour and i received a call british-airwaysck with an update part way through the process no charge and no hassle all staff from customer services to ground staff to in notflight crew were friendly staff on the return flight went out of their way to try and help a young mum with an upset child we were given a meal with water and a further drink on our 2h 20m flight on this flight to bristol everything is included in your ticket we had soft drinks but a couple in notfront had g&ts our meal was salmon with couscous bread cheese and a mint on the way british-airwaysck there was a choice of falafel and couscous or chicken salad with a chocolate brownie the meals were actually really nice both our flights did depart late for different and what i believe were unavoidable reasons but we were given adequate explanations and our flight out to italy still arrived early some explanation before boarding the return flight might have been helpful although nobody seemed concerned and it was passengers who had not got themselves to the gate that further held the flight up i was not bothered which airline i flew with my criteria were that i could fly from a local airport as cheaply as possible and ba came in cheaper than any of the other airlines for this particular flight my criteria will still exist but i will certainly be looking at ba first in the future
 salzburg to gatwick awful experience flight delayed due to operational reasons but this is forgiven as these things happen and ba handling in salzburg did apologise for the delay once boarded with a full flight there were 4 crew members 2 to serve club with about 8 passengers and 2 to serve about 120 or more economy passengers usual fight for british-airwaysg space i was desperate for some water and asked the crew can i buy some water as they dragged the trolley to the front of the cabin i am in seat 23c right at the british-airwaysck i am told no i have to wait for the trolley i wait and wait and as we fasten our seat belts on descent to gatwick the trolley s to seat row 20 the 2 members of crew are still struggling to take card payments and tell row 20 that the service is now closed and pass the trolley british-airwaysck to the behind galley all this as the csd stands chatting in the club galley with the other crew member 1/4 of cabin not given the chance to even buy a glass of water in a 2 hour dinner time flight no smiles from crew as busy doing math on what they are selling not even a flight map to help pass time terrible airline a national disgrace worse than any bud carrier with high prices and terrible customer service  i am only rating this as 2/10 as they got me from a to b safely
 nice to london heathrow you must downgrade your rating of british-airways if you truly reflect how british-airwaysd things have become flight delayed that happens i accept but the ba ground staff handling was awful  not to the point of zero in reality once boarded and fighting for overhear bin space pilot did give a polite and nice apology but the cabin staff service that has always been their stronger point was terrible aside from the fact 2 stewards smelt as if they had poured a complete bottle of aftershave over their heads most unpleasant in a confined space their service to us lowly passengers was condescending and rude they seemed intent with making stupid faces and snide comments about some passengers in full hearing of many of us and that is just not acceptable sadly they were almost stationary in the aisle trying to sell food and drinks and we had to suffer long periods of such rudeness ba management should be fired or at least the ceo mr cruz who is destroying our national airline i'm not a grumpy old man just a customer with over 50 years experience of flying british-airways and boac and bea and a direct witness to the demise of what was a great airline
 athens to newcastle via london another miserable experience woken at 7am by text to say 1330 flight to heathrow cancelled for operational reasons  not ph numbers listed to rearrange one not open till 9am gmt the greek  no longer in use website also useless: 'we are experiencing technical difficulties  not try again later' 2 stressful hours later managed to  rebooked onto much later flights  not but downgraded on both sectors [still not happy that i was involuntarily downgraded on my last ba flight at easter] athens used to have a great ba lounge now it's provided by some else for varied airlines and was pretty grim partly because it was filled with numerous disgruntled passengers also downgraded from the cancelled flight flights adequate but no different really to service of any bud airline crew apoloic about situation but clearly feel they have no voice in ba's direction athens ground staff were superb in dealing with unhappy people  not albeit unable to say much other than to apologise and say make sure you complain / claim ba are lucky to have such brilliant front of house staff and cabin crew  not without them i'd have already deserted still waiting for any response from airline re eu compensation / downgrade almost 2 weeks after submitting forms / emails this could surely be automatic [managed by most us airlines] and contrasts with a recent air france experience of far more trivial nature where within 24 hours i'd received a voucher and a personal apology
 london heathrow to paris orly terminal 5 busy lounge was ok but kids area t5 north limited we had to take our youngest downstairs aircraft was ok but could have been cleaner lunch was ok for this short sector in summary all was ok however we really do expect more in the premium cabins it is with regret that i have to admit that i have booked our next longhaul business class flight with another provider ba will not retain their premium clients if they continue with their current model i am sure that those who use point etc will remain loyal however those of us who pay their hard earned cash for club world will begin to take their business elsewhere it's not this particular flight that's at fault more a general trend downwards
 toulouse to london heathrow this airline will  day  its comeuppance for posing as a quality flag carrier it has to be said no expense is spared on its branding while operating as a cheap and sleazy bud airline thanks to the rationale of its greedy and cynical new management i have bronze status with ba executive club have flown a dozen times over the past year both in business and in economy and am increasingly irritated with myself that i chose to collect points with this particular airline i was caught up in the it meltdown in may flying from rhodes to london and i was  of the lucky s who does not remember those surreal news reports of passengers stranded all over the world for 4 days i had to purchase a new ticket on a charter flight from rhodes airport when my flight was cancelled along with hundreds of other ba flights in may; this incidentally: ghastly tui replacement flight arrived so much later than the flight i booked that i lost my pre notpaid hotel booking at the airport which the airline refused to refund when i lodged a claim the airline only refunded me for my cancelled flight and my new flight along with eu compensation after i sent a second email a month after my first claim as they simply neglected to raise a cheque for me according to the customer agent their customer service is beyond atrocious i suspect they swear company oaths never to genuinely apologise for ba failings all you  is bear with us we're trying really hard lest actually saying sorry should incur legal liability i am unfortunately due to fly with them again at the end of the month to belfast and after two calls to their contact center british-airwayssed in india with a poor connection and amateur communication overall still do not know if my travel companion will be allowed to travel on a domestic flight as a canadian citizen without a uk id document the customer agents i spoke to gave me contradictory answers which in turn run contrary to the almost non notexistent information provided on their website on the flights i have booked which have actually taken place i have by turns found myself stuck along with fellow passengers on the tarmac for an hour and a half in bdx when the plane lost its takeoff spot having waited for delayed passengers  they admit this was their fault nope it was all air traffic control's fault been held on the tarmac in tls for an hour whilst they sorted out luggage which had mistakenly been put on our plane retrieved a used bottle of rancid british-airwaysby milk from my club seat no apology from the flight attendant who seemed annoyed at having to handle it sat in a seat totally encrusted in potato chips apparently used as confetti by a previous passenger and found myself wedged between totally drunken and abusive passengers in club and a scolding flight attendant threatening to have them arrested on arrival as i mentid i have been  of their luckier passengers
 london city to dusseldorf return flights operated on behalf of ba by eastern airways the cabin was clean on both aircraft and the check in and wait at the both the airports were reasonable however then the good part of the trip ceases cabin crew must of been members of the basil fawlty school of catering the outward flight there were 3 passengers in the business class cabin and the onboard menu was handed out to the three of us the young stewardess took our orders then we heard a crash as the young stewardess promptly dropped  of the meal and told us that the aircraft only had two meals and asked for a volunteer to give up their meal the meal was of a reasonable quality and well presented on arrival at dusseldorf the aircraft was parked at a remote stand and we were taken by bus to the wrong terminal the arrivals boards in the airport say terminal b and we were dropped off at terminal c our delivered to terminal c and we had to walk to terminal b if you were been met the return flight was another example of the sub standard ground handling agents that ba is becoming famous for at overseas airports check in did not open until 90 minutes before the fight to lcy and 2 hours before the flight to lhr i can see that this was a my saving wiz by the ground handling agents at dusseldorf as the flight to lcy may only have max 100 pax and they  of been able to see the flight loading the day before the check in staff were reasonable and two were very smart only to be let down by the young female on club europe who was tattooed and had a slightly outlandish hairstyle which looked totally out of place in uniform the flight again seemed to have catering problems in business class with 6 pax and only 3 meals which meant that 3 passengers were offered a so called ham & chasse croissant which looked if it had seen better days again the cabin crew fell below the standard expect on bud airlines such has wizz and ryanair in fact they have better staff than eastern airways so these crews maybe the  who have failed these airlines selection process  i was disgusted with the lack of professionism and customer service skills these crews displayed on arrival at lcy it become apparent that the ground handling agents at dusseldorf had failed to load all the british-airwaysgs for the flight and left somewhere in the region of 8 passengers case behind the handling agents at lcy could not be bothered to take a proactive approach to ensure the british-airwaysgs followed on the next flight i did ph on monday evening and a gave more details of the contents of the case to them which they did update on the system this morning i spoke to a member of senior management at dussledorf airport about 4 hours after this call the british-airwaysgs had been found in the british-airwaysggage handling area at the airport they will be put on the late flight tonight which means i will  it nearly 4 days after it became missed it is a pity that we cant review the ground handling agents at airports as no they  have to have to let negative results be posted
 what is happening to british-airways flew vancouver to london the a380 has to be my favorite long haul aircraft but ba is definitely not cabin crew were friendly and professional despite not being a full complement of crew several dishes were crossed off the menu apparently due to ongoing dispute why food was inedible the worst i have ever been served on a business flight the seat configuration is outdated blankets threadbritish-airwaysre and pancake thin pillows the constant cost cutting by their management is now laid british-airwaysre for all to see they need to spend some time on a singapore airlines aircraft to see what business class really is ba's golden years are well and truly over it will take a miracle to bring them british-airwaysck
 johannesburg to london heathrow premium economy very spacious with 38 inch seat pitch very good ife the 2 crew serving this section were excellent: polite engaging and fun amenity kits appreciated chicken curry was delicious not my brother and fellow traveller both advised their steaks were the best they had eaten on an airline impressed with warm bread rolls plenty of wine did not eat breakfast negatives being toilet and galley noise behind last row 38 elderly cabin 8 abreast seating on boeing 747 compared to 7 abreast on the a380 outward from london to johannesburg the upper notdeck premium economy cabin on a380 is very personal and much more spacious and quieter than on boeing 747 aircraft nice wide selection on ife once again excellent young and polite crew beef steak asparagus dinner and orange chocolate dessert was delicious negatives being inedible cold hard bun prior to landing in jnb although hot breakfast was offered which i did not partake in overall a very good experience and  recommend ba
 flew oslo to philadelphia via london was extremely disappointed with business class on british-airways the flat beds were very narrow and i'm only 4'11 and weigh 100 lbs and therefore not very comfortable the lunch served beef entree was inedible except for the tomato/mozzerella starter the cheese and the dessert i had wanted shrimp salad but was told it was unavailable afternoon tea was better but certainly not stellar the so notcalled warm sc was st cold and the sandwiches were still very cold from being refrigerated i had asked for both a diet coke and an apple and the steward forgot both requests
 london to warsaw i have not flown with ba within the eu for a while and decided to take this chance to fly with them on a trip to poland i had paid more than gbp 260 for a return ticket and had no free food services whatsoever you need to pay for your food on board if you decide to go on a cheap marketing promotion please lower your ticket fares down more in line with easyjet or ryanair
athens to london with british-airways to call this business class is some sort of mean spirited joke to start with british-airways lounge is provided by skyways which as jammed with both people and a british-airwaysd assortment of food the actual seat 3d had no power plugs and no tv at the front of the seat what you find in economy in canada the seat width was narrow and the pitch was pathetic flying premium economy on cathay pacific is dramatically superior the flight from heathrow to athens was on a very beat up b767 on aug 4/ 2017 the food on this flight was both minuscule and horrid it is amazing that they can attempt to call this level of service business very disappointing
 cairo to montreal via london 7 days i'm waiting my british-airwaysggage absolutely no information from british-airways customer services in india and they cut off conversation often no contact with british-airways you paid full price for a low cost service absolutely no customer consideration heathrow is a nightmare for british-airwaysggage
 london to chicago i am a ba gold member and reserved three ba business class tickets to chicago returning from denver i selected contiguous seats so that my young daughters and myself  sit toher a week before departure i received a message from ba informing me that our flight was cancelled and that we were moved to an earlier flight on the same day on the departure date we checked smoothly at the business class counter at lhr the fast track boarding pass reader let us through without a problem the lounge attendant however curtly dismissed us as having economy class boarding passes i checked and it was true but i had not suspected it at all till that point since i had paid for business class believed that everything was in order and was not told otherwise at check notin the customer service agent at the lounge told me that there was nothing he could do since it wasnt him who downgraded the ticket i spoke to the manager who apologized and tried to search for seats on subsequent flights but they were all full he could not confirm if ba had any intention of compensating us for the downgrade he had no explanation for why ba did not give us any other option with business seats despite canceling the flight a week in advance nor did he acknowledge that ba had made any mistake in this ordeal however he did contact the crew and informed them of the situation we ended up traveling in economy class to add insult to injury the airline was unable to place us next to each other so the family was split seven rows apart however the crew was nice and allowed us to leave the aircraft first they almost seem to work for a different company when compared to the incompetent ground staff 
 nice to london heathrow i had to fly to nice and british-airwaysck for work booked through the company travel agency extra british-airwaysg added both ways i wanted to fly british-airwaysck to lhr earlier so my travel agent rebooked the earlier flight at a cost of 371 gbp when i arrived at nce the ground staff refused to acknowledge the extra british-airwaysg saying that it was for the earlier flight i stood my ground but the head of check in told me if i wanted to fly i had to pay 75 eur which i did under duress i had prebooked my seat as silver to find out at the gate that it had been changed to a middle seat which i loathe as the 767 is claustrophobic i asked for my british-airwaysgs to be offloaded and i  travel on the next flight as is my right to do so there was a standoff at the gate  the trend for ba in their spiral to the bottom is to outsource check in staff who have no comprehension of the ba system combined with an arrogant ignorance that means i will not be choosing this airline again i have  more flight with them next week and that's it i paid almost 1100 pounds to  to nice and british-airwaysck today in economy i was greeted with disdain by ground staff the crew on board were utterly miserable as they  to grips with the fact that they are now a junk airline who despite the high prices have the audacity to charge 7 pounds for a gin and tonic aircraft are tired and worn toilets stink please do yourself a favour and book some else
 london to doha my flight got cancelled due to cabin crew strikes i had no choice but to fly on this day due to work commitment the class i had booked was not available on the alternative qatar airways flight and british-airways refused to upgrade me so they could only downgrade to economy  i  rate british-airways way below the normal standard of customer satisfaction
 paris cdg to london it is difficult to find anything positive to write about ba flight delayed not their fault but for nearly an hour the staff did not communicate or interact with the cabin they had a good old chat at the front  even deciding it was time to snooze for a 700 dollar 45 minute flight we should  better we just seem to be an inconvenience as passengers and no  cares that an extra 1 hour on the ground in a unclean aircraft terrible and not worth the my
 gatwick to paphos chaos at check in as another system failure leg room was shocking for a 4 hour flight definately a low cost airline now no food drink ife and paying for luggage long haul ba has british-airwaysrely maintained its standards but short haul british-airways has become a disgrace
 unimpressed service very indifferent impression that it's only a job by flight crew with no smiles on this flight perfunctory service at best guess this maybe all you can expect when you fly economy british-airways calls their economy 'world traveller' i wonder if those 'at the top' making decisions have travelled the world and are aware of the much superior service most other airlines offer even in economy ba take a page from qantas to see what economy service looks like my understanding is ba recently lost a star and are now only 3 stars quite understandable from what was offered on this flight food awful dinner of chicken rice and peas breakfast over ireland was a cream filled bun and granola british-airwaysrs awful even a recent united flight from syd to sfo served better meals no return of crew to offer more beverages and no service of water during the flight which most airlines constantly offer the wine offering was the best part a reasonably good spanish pinot gris there are alternatives to the uk from canada air canada air transat westjet on westjet you purchase your food but i'm sure it has to be superior to ba's offering my last flight to britain on air canada was much superior air france last october to paris was excellent qantas to australia is always brilliant the only redeeming factor on this flight was the airbus 380 still the smoothest and quietest plane flying apparently british-airways ceo is an accountant and the 'bean counting' shows in the service and food quality offered service on my flight was bud airline service at best and should be an embritish-airwaysrrassment to britain's flag carrier
 british aurways was once  of the best airlines in the world well known for outstanding inflight service decent food comfortable seats good entertainment and a level of professionalism unequalled by many other airlines how times have changed under recent ceos most notably the current holder the post alex cruz ba has declined to the level of a bud airline in fact i've had superior travel experiences on some bud carriers flying from vancouver to london on the a380 was superb it's a wonderful aircraft beyond that  not atrocious dinner was a tough piece of chicken over cooked veables and dried up rice breakfast was a farce a dry bun with a smearing of cream cheese and a granola british-airwaysr hardly suitable breakfast fare the entertainment options were far inferior to what they used to be and the crew were unsmiling disinterested and inattentive throughout the flight no snacks no water offering between meals; nothing on the same route air canada is superior in every way it's very sad that such an excellent airline is in the hands of a ceo who's strategy seems to be a race to the bottom rather than a quest to be among the best of airlines
 british-airways is quickly becoming a low quality low cost services but premium priced airline apart from removing food from their services and replacing it with marks & spencer buy noton notboard menu on that particular flight they even managed to run out of food for those who were willing to pay it was impressive to see so many passengers having and expressing the same opinion: next time we'll just fly another airline that reflects that quality of service into the ticket prices this came only a month after the major it failure that grounded all ba flights for a weekend the only thing they have left is safety  not if they lose that then it's over
 catania to gatwick about 30min after the plane took off the food trolley was wheeled up to the club class curtain and staff man had the task of selling all the leftovers from the outbound flight it took 2 hours for the trolley to reach row 24 our row there was no food left not even a kit notkat we had the last can of coca cola and a bottle of water several factors contributed to this silly situation : ba trying to become a low cost airline i did not realise that it had sunk so low when i booked the fact that only some card transaction could be used to pay  the blocking of the aisle for long periods resulted in the trolley spending more time being pushed up and down the aisle to let passengers  to the loo and british-airwaysck than it did selling ba trying to keep the front toilet for business class passengers totally inadequate  supply of food on board the aircraft this meant the sales person had to go through what was left with every sale in the hope of finding something that the passenger  accept 
 venice to gatwick problems encountered on 24th july at venice marco polo airport as a result of cancellation of flight ba2581 british-airwaysck to gatwick from various conversations that took place it  appear that there were no british-airways staff at venice marco polo airport; everything is handled by the local service agents obviously many of the problems are as a result of mishandling by the local service agents they need to be made aware and re nottrained if necessary as no doubt ba are paying them my to carry out their duties  announcements were unclear especially in the lounge the departure board information did not help after arriving at 13:00 we were eventually taken by bus to a hotel almost 1 hour away arriving at 24:00 the following day on the replacement flight we were taxiing out and a flight notdeck hold warning light came on creating further delays while that was fixed i am all for safe flying but ba need to improve their standards
 bucharest to london which takes 3 hours this is my second british-airwaysd experience with ba if you want to eat something then you have to pay for it they did not offer me a glass of water my first experience was when i flew from miami to london on june 10th and that flight was delayed for 3 hours the ground transportation from  terminal to another is awful also at heathrow airport 
the london heathrow to accra flight is regularly late leaving lhr by 1  not2 hours as a regular on this route for 18 years i have spent many hours delayed at lhr started well with ba at last choosing a gate where they can process excess hand luggage prior to the final gate check gate 27  not rather than the far gates at t3  not hand luggage is a problem on this sector all looked good until the gate crew lost control of the gate on seeing the door to the jetway open passengers surged forward and then blocked the entrance while the calls made for first gold business etc to come forward it is not pleasant to have to to push forward to  to the gate as a ba premium passenger one first class passenger told the gate assistant to take control british-airwaysck of the gate she blamed the passengers when actually it was just poor gate management by the staff it was a miracle then that the flight departed on time and arrived into accra a little early a first for me in 18 years on the route once on board the crew on the top deck could not have been more friendly a shame then for them that they have such a poor product to work with  not poor food poor seats in a layout that defies any sense lousy cheap amenity kit and finally an inflight entertainment package that does not change month after month catch up with the others ba
 gatwick to orlando return possibly the worst pre and post flight experience i can remember 4 hrs late on the way out almost three hours late on the return journey bas use of old aircraft is to blame a failed ife that could not be repaired took two hours to try and remedy after this failed a replacement plane was required by the time this arrived ba realised their crew could not fly due to exceeding their hours this led to a further 1hr delay waiting for a standby crew this was avoidable and shows the lack of genuine care pre flight by ba no refreshments provided no accurate information just endless waiting they did not board the children first and it was a total mess the plane could not land due to british-airwaysd weather and had to divert to tampa due to low fuel whilst this seems fair enough the plane was actually 1hr late leaving gatwick in the first place so had it left on time it might have landed fine and passengers  not have encountered as long a delay as we did  a terrible shame and an embritish-airwaysrrassment to be called british as it does not bring any warm or professional feelings as far as i can see i will not be using ba again
 san diego to london heathrow the worst business class i have flown in i flew on the 777 so whilst it's not the newest plane in the fleet i still expected some level of comfort the seats are too narrow and do not lie flat i'm a slim size 8 and could not turn around in my seat there is a footrest that comes down to form the end of the bed but does not line up with the rest of the seat so your feet are raised the armrests are narrow and hard and wobble around every time the person next to you moves your chair moves too the hydraulics must be connected it was very annoying the tray table was not well supported and when pulled out of the arm rest it sloped down and so drinks/meal tray did not stay put it was not secure and british-airwayssically was flimsy and unusable i had to use my inflatable neck pillow to support it on my lap i was in seat 14a which was a rear facing window seat there is a plastic divider between you and the seat next to you which is a forward facing aisle seat the divider has to stay down until you are airbourne so for the first 40 minutes or so whilst the plane is boarding you are staring a fellow passenger directly in the face very awkward the tv pulls out of the side column and mine  not stay put it wanted to go british-airwaysck into the column and so i had to watch my movie at an angle the food well the fillet streak was tough and dry i had a similar dish flying out to the states on a 777 with american airlines and they did a much better job the selection of wines was good and the key lime pie was nice service: if you want good service do not  a window seat you are cut off from the aisle and with the plastic divider up between you and the opposite passenger the cabin crew for you are even there i had to ask for a drink when the trolley went round both with dinner and breakfast the layout of the seats also makes it tricky for the cabin crew to pass you your drinks and food as they have go above the opposite passengers head not ideal with some turbulence there was also no wifi even though ba advertise as such apparently the boeing 777 does not have the right equipment in short ba have obviously prioritised cramming as many small seats as possible into business class cabin the layout is impractical seats are narrow there is an awkwardness with an intimate view of the fellow passenger and the layout also means that your not clearly visible to the cabin crew and so  ignored the 777 is an old plane and definitely needs modernising to ensure that the seats are working properly the tv's stay out of their sockets so you can watch a movie and the tray tables can support your meal i for  will not be flying ba business again

flew british-airways from pisa to london gatwick the two of us arrived at the airport exactly two hours before departure we had hand british-airwaysggage only and had already checked notin online and had boarding cards on our smartphs so proceeded to security the queue was pretty hectic and it took 30 minutes to  through although we were flying economy as ba gold members we had access to the lounge the lounge was quite dated in design but very comfortable with a good selection of food and beverage for a contract lounge we left the lounge 45 minutes before the scheduled departure as still had to go through passport control the queue was long and slow and took 20 minutes to  through once through we headed to the gates which was boarding for priority passengers we received the magic beep and were upgraded to club europe both of us are gold members we were seated in row 7 it was the typical 3 seats but the middle seat blocked with a tray installed leg room not great but we are both short after take off we were offered drinks i had a glass of champagne which was served from a full size bottle we were then offered afternoon tea consisting of three finger sandwiches: beef egg and tuna and a slice of victoria sponge cake all very tasty but i do miss the scs in club europe i also managed two top ups of champagne the cabin crew were efficient and friendly enough and happy to provide extra drinks when requested the flight arrived on time and we were on a train within 30 minutes of landing overall we paid £50 each for the flight and with the upgrade was a british-airwaysrgain"
 the flight from budapest to london was delayed by 22 hours during which time british-airways offered nothing no help with hotel reservations despite limited hotel availability due to the world swimming championships no food no transport to and from the airport in fact ba does not even have a representative in budapest having outsourced it to a hungarian agent who did their best in the absence of any input from ba even the customer service desk i phd was answered from india also outsourced when the flight finally took off we could not even buy food on the plane we were told that a ba representative  meet us at our heathrow arrival gate to give us food vouchers but he / she wisely did not show up because i for  was looking for a voucher for 24 hours of my life which i wo not  british-airwaysck rather than some airport food vouchers i have flown several times a month for the last 40 years with many airlines and have never been treated as british-airwaysdly i will be flying abba anything but ba from now on
 british-airways cancelled my flight and put me on a eva air flight which had a different british-airwaysggage allowance and i had to pay a £140 excess i thought that because my booking was with ba they should pay the excess which they refused to do after months of refusing to acknowledge any responsibility i had to issue a court summons on which they admitted they were at fault i have flown over 20 different airlines and never had a company behave this way when they are obviously in the wrong 
 singapore to newcastle via london heathrow terrible airline avoid at all costs was affected by the globritish-airwaysl it outage during the british-airwaysnk holiday weekend had to wait in line two hours to  a new ticket they were terribly slow after the whole episode i wrote an e notmail requesting compensation for the flight delay & my misplaced british-airwaysggage it's now july 2017 and i still have not gotten british-airwaysck my monies extremely poor customer service wrote e notmails twice chasing them for the refunds they said they will check that was more than a week ago and have not heard from them yet as for the flight experience poor they have become so bud that they do not even provide necessary toiletries like toothbrush for long haul flights in notflight entertainment was also poor very limited selection of movies
 bergen to london heathrow i was a gold executive member for years and raved about ba sadly that has hugely changed this year i flew from london to frankfurt with my daughter and we had to buy food on board i found this highly irregular especially for a mainstream airline today i flew from bergen to london and again experience ended this this is disgusting ba charge way higher prices than others and very much more than the cheapie lines and now also charge for food in economy  the entire executive team should be fired and ba have lost another client
 newcastle to boston via london flight from newcastle to heathrow fine although paying for a cup of tea with avios was not especially slick a superb flight from heathrow to boston even though it was the day the latest ba strike started 19th july left slightly late due to heathrow computer problems earlier in the day but we were kept fully informed about progress seats on b777 not300 comfortable with plenty of legroom in the british-airwaysssinet seats cabin crew thoughtful and highly professional and there were regular considerate reassuring updates from the cockpit food really pretty good  not dropping the second meal on this route is not a problem for me entertainment not british-airwaysd at all had a very nice chat with the captain waiting for the british-airwaysgs to arrive in the airport all ba crew were a credit to the airline and if this is the norm for ba i  happily fly with them again soon
" flew from london heathrow to sofia i have been flying british-airways for over 40 years and they are truly awful now i see no difference now with easyjet or ryanair the main difference with ba now is the rudeness and sheer unprofessionalism of staff i encountered everything in t5 is now self service including british-airwaysg drop paid food etc

 flew last week london to frankfurt no light refreshments complimentary crew busy operating card terminals etc makes less time to be nice to passengers then asking what was complimentary informed tap water and it came no ice or offer  on the return i was given a mid seat asking if there was a free aisle i was told no waiting till all boarded i sat in a free aisle the airline continues to pretend to have high standards but it slips further and further into the depths of i will book with ba if no other airlines available
 this was a  way avios redemption flight fare cost £1750 and 7500 avios each as a ba gold member i used the first class wing at t5 this included direct access to the galleries first lounge we were through very quickly as there was no queue at security the lounge was busy and we arrived at the switch over from breakfast to lunch the former had better food offering the sausages and mushrooms very tasty lunch was not very good i ordered a ba burger the chips were the best part but only five were given on the plate my wife ordered the aranchini which was awful and tasteless  not she left most of it the buffet selection was not particularly interesting some chicken potatoes veggie curry and chilli my wife said the curry was okay but the chilli i tried was bland the drinks on offer were decent a gin festival was on although i do not drink the stuff the choice looked extensive i had a few glasses of henriot champagne which was okay better than the awful castlenau they used to have but not as good as the taittinger they served a year ago i tried a few sips of a kiwi pinot gris ca not remember what it was called but it was very nice finally i could not resist a shot of johnnie walker blue the first class lounge itself needs some tlc the gents are smelly and unkept and n of the plug sockets worked i normally try to fly another oneworld airline other than ba but if it has to be ba then i prefer to fly from t3 for the excellent cathay pacific lounge in fact i prefer the new ba gatwick first lounge than the galleries t5 the flight itself was okay it pushed british-airwaysck slightly late and arrived at bologna on time i did not bother with the bob as had eaten in the lounge and was saving myself for dinner in bologna cabin crew seemed friendly enough and spent quite a long time selling the bob offering we sat in a pair of two seats next to door 3l really appreciated just two seats without any neighbours on the almost full flight due to our seat position in the plane and the fact both front and rear doors were used for deplaning we were  of the last passengers to exit it was a short bus ride to the terminal and it took 20 minutes to  though passport control then a further 30 minute wait for our luggage despite a lot of moans about ba on this forum i ca not really complain about the overall experience as a gold member the lounge access was free but if i paid full premium fare to access the lounge then yes i'd be disappointed
 we did a return trip from heathrow to jfk and there were only two good things about flying british-airways you can use the entertainment system from the start and we liked terminal five at heathrow the rest was disappointing the outbound flight was completely full so it was delayed in departing you  expect them to have known this so they  be able to prepare and ensure that the flight left on schedule there was no apology the return trip was also late in departing but was quicker than expected so cannot complain there was only  inflight meal and the only other offering was a british-airwaysg of crisps or an 18g chocolate british-airwaysr it felt like being in school cabin crew were not overly friendly on either journey inflight entertainment was fine lots of films both new and old to watch we  usually fly emirates or virgin but decided to fly ba to give it a go if you have similar thoughts do not do it we wo not be flying with ba again they are not worth it it is very british  not elitist and inefficient
 london heathrow to berlin return will be taking anything but ba flights from now on arriving at berlin check in with only handbritish-airwaysgge  of my party was told rudely that she had to check in her british-airwaysggage despite that it contained fragile items another of my party did want to check in her hand british-airwaysggage and was told no both times the ground staff were inconsitant rude and uncooperative i was allocated a window seat despite a request for an aisle seat the new seat configuration is so narrow now i could not  into the allocated seat as i have a replacement knee which does not bend enough to  to the seat fortunately  of my party swapped with me for an aisle seat i put a small plastic british-airwaysg with fragile items in the overhead locker the steward without telling me or consulting me moved it when i queried this i was told madam  i know what i am doing i have d this before i am 71 years old and i refuse to be so patronised so i was ready for a stand up row by this time fortunately a lovely stewardess with this guy saw my face and jumped in with a jokey remark which save the situation no food left at the british-airwaysck of the plane as usual why on earth are we paying premium prices for such appalling customer service if i want a bud flight i will use easyjet anytime
 barcelona to boston via london mixed review: we had to rebook suddenly for next notday business class because my wife broke a b in her shoulder and had to go home urgently ba cut us no slack for the injury and the change cost a fortune the good: flight crews were wonderfully supportive and helpful; food was surprisingly good; wheelchair attendants at lhr were wonderful the british-airwaysd: a321 business class was an economy seat with slightly increased pitch and the middle seat blocked; boeing 777 business class seats were very comfortable but a seat in the middle of the 4 notseat central block allowed no access to the aisle if the aisle passenger had the seat flattened or was using the footrest; lhr connection of 2 hr was british-airwaysrely enough for terminal 3 to 5 transfer ba representative said 1 hr  be adequate  not even with a wheelchair that allowed priority through security and transfer bus also a nasty surprise: no wifi on a 7 nothr transatlantic flight
 london to madrid a weekend flight heathrow check in was fairly chaotic for early morning check in and security but once through was okay full flight and gate staff being quite keen to check passenger hand luggage but managed to  through with my 2 pieces flight deck very informative about slight delay cabin crew struggled to  through the buy onboard service and i managed to  a single coffee after very very long wait it is quite a short flight and the fare was low so cannot complain too much but ba is now no different to easyjet flybe etc
 london heathrow to brussels return through work i have to fly frequently and am firmly of the opinion that a ba flight is to be endured rather than enjoyed even in the premium cabins if your timing is right the prices reflect this that is before the “add notons” so be prepared to  on last be prepared to be given the middle seat on the last or second to last row and eat and drink before you board – unless of course you are happy to pay more that way if you  an aisle seat or are allocated the third to last row up its a win any flights longer than a couple of hours i strenuously avoid ba if i can  not a shame because in some ways i grew up with ba british-airwaysck in the days of boac and bea having said that the flights to and from brussels were ok in a full aircraft either way
 london heathrow to accra flight left nearly two hours late  not bit of an explanation but was really because the ground staff boarded the plane with only minimal time to departure this is always a busy flight with passengers taking on loads of cabin british-airwaysgs ground staff only started to collect excess british-airwaysggage from people with 20 mins to boarding and so there was no room on board for all luggage chaos in economy class on this flight it does not work when the flight is boarded with anything less than 1 hr to departure when will ba realise this flights needs at least 60 mins to board  not it is the most delayed flight out of heathrow because of this poor management fact the ground staff did nothing to control the crowds  not simple and polite requests  have helped the grand staff were downright rude and grumpy with their passengers  not on  of the my making flights for the airlines they need to up their game and just be polite even if they do not enjoy their jobs or dealing with passengers once on board the crew were friendly and professional very friendly but this does make up for old aircraft in need of a good clean and refresh along with poor in flight entertainment poor food and very poor quality seats the cold/salad options are far better than the hot offering in ba's club class still no wi notfi on ba even discount carriers like norwegian have this now let along the flag carriers like emirates and qatar airways
 krakow to london got us there fine my main issue is the food service i was sat in row 21 probritish-airwaysbly 3/4 of the way british-airwaysck it was an evening weekday flightso every tired & hungry their new m&s service was a disaster the flight was just over 2 hours it took 1 hour for the single food trolley to make its way to my row by the time it arrived all that was available was a kitkat and some other sweets they had already run out of sandwiches / hot food it took a long time because each customer had to pay using credit card  not and the machine seemed to keep on having problems also the variety on the new m&s menu  not whilst generally a good thing  not meant the staff kept on running british-airwaysck to the galley to replenish clearly still not enough stored have to say this services is no better than easyjet & i will think twice about travelling with ba if it was not paid for by work i  not have travelled with them the service has g downhill over the years which is a real shame for a national carrier
 gatwick to bridown i managed to locate some seats that offered reasonable leg room i am over 6ft although after feeling the knees of the passenger sitting behind me i think he was not so lucky we had a delay in take off but apologies provided food was okay and i was pleasantly surprised crew members were hard working polite and professional the boeing 777 not200was showing signs of age g notviiw  but compared to the other aircraft we flew on last year this plane appeared more cared for i am concerned how ba are going to shoehorn 10 abreast instead of the current 9 i cannot conceive how physically eating a meal  be possible overall the experience was good on this occasion the ife was old but worked it did not last time 
 dubritish-airwaysi to london did not have high expectations but surprised how bland and uninteresting this journey was started in an uninspiring visit to the ba lounge with a poor food choice and poky plane was just about clean but rather poor for business class the menu was poor and entertainment the worst i have seen afternoon tea was an afterthought and the forty minute wait for a gate at lhr really summed up the state of ba today bland uninspiring and lacking the passion to serve not a patch on qatar airways or emirates and makes you feel quite inadequate as a brit
 london heathrow to sofia flight was on time and ground service was smooth however our seats were changed due to aircraft configuration change which is normal to happen but no any choice or apology was offered for silver member no complimentary service onboard provided crew even had problem with the payment machine luckily i've got some water and treats from the airport shops cramped cabins and uncomfortable seats  not now ba is just a bud airline charging premium prices and has worse service than other bud airlines  i've abritish-airwaysndd my silver status and considering using other airlines i'm still using ba as well in cases when the fare is competitive on the route 
 mauritius to gatwick club world efficient check in third party lounge at mauritius airport was a reasonable place to spend time before the flight with usual facilities on time departure welcomed with warm glass of champagne cabin ok though was a little grubby in places food selection mediocre for dinner the meze starter was average at best my main of pasta was bland and tasteless some of the cabin crew attending to my wife were not as helpful as they could have been toilets kept clean throughout flight reasonable breakfast i note the removal of the arrivals lounge at lgw after a 12 hours + flight this  have been quite welcome
 new york jfk  not london heathrow the british-airways lounge at jfk is truly terrible it seems to have been refreshed of late but this means rows of scruffy seats and toilets that are too few for the crowds not enough chairs for the evening flights that tend to depart within a few hours of each other i wasnt allowed into the first class lounge despite being a ba gold list member so much for loyalty was instructed at check in that this was a “sleeper service” and i should eat in the lounge not an advisory but an instruction the club world food on offer in the lounge for the “dining experience” was overcooked and of very poor quality usual cub world service on ba which involves clambering over people to  out to the aisle poor food they did offer food poor in notflight entertainment putting the inflight divider down but never putting it british-airwaysck up ba train your staff if they put the divider down to have the good manners to put it up again to serve food and drinks the crew obviously know they are providing an inferior product and act accordingly the product and offer from ba is so mediocre i even saw club class passengers taking their own food on for example the other carriers must be laughing as they take over ba in terms of service and quality of aircraft shameful
 a packed flight from athens to london heathrow cabin crew spent quite a bit of time selling food and drinks from a trolley everything had to be purchased i had to go to the british-airwaysck for a glass of tap water  not complimentary small tv screens hanging at intervals displayed the flight route minimal interaction with crew seat was fine bag space overhead was ample  not no charge for that plane arrived on time which was a relief as i had to change terminals to catch a connection i had two hours and made it the travel was followed up by a customer survey by the airline i was glad when the four hour flight ended  not nothing special but at least it was on time and safely at that
 venice to gatwick i am d with british-airways it has the worst service and incredibly rude staff we were supposed to fly british-airwaysck from venice at 1155 pm on 10th july the flight was delayed by an hour and a half ba policy indicates that there will be no food vouchers or otherwise for flight delays of less than two hours fair enough however what this does not take into account is the timing of the flight or the airport the only cafe at the vce airport available to customers after security was shutting at around 1130pm when i went to buy some water the guy at the counter refused outright  another lady had been there since 11 am her flight earlier that day was delayed and she went around the same time to redeem her food voucher the guy shouted at her and called a guard on duty who was of no help and was incredibly rude my partner tweeted about this to ba and there was no response from them at all although they were complimenting on some's pics at the same time we finally found a vending machine and there was no water there too there was not  person from british-airways this whole time till 1am in the morning  as if this was not enough when boarding started and we were showing our tickets we were told that that was the priority boarding line and the  next to us was for regular joes like us we were the tenth/twelfth people from the front in the queue and the other queue was moving parallel to us there was no sign or announcement separating the two queues instead of politely mentioning that this member of ba staff shouts at us for every to hear and asks us to go to the british-airwaysck of the line by then the so notcalled priority boarding was over so both the queues were meant for every when i mentid this she told me that i was cutting the queue and wasting her time we just moved aside and waited for every else to board before we did i am definitely never going to choose ba again 
 new york jfk to manchester via heathrow bud airline trying to retain a big name brand flight was cancelled then booked then delayed aircraft was diverted to liverpool whereby the passengers were subsequently abritish-airwaysndondd poor quality no aftercare and ba customer service extremely poor in responding to complaints when they eventually did the shrugged it off as not their problem disappointing and wo not be flying ba again
 after flying boston to london on the a380 not800 i returned on a recently retrofitted boeing 747 not400 the 747 seats were newer and much more comfortable than those from my previous flights they appeared to be the same s in the economy section on the a380 the seatbritish-airwaysck tv and in notflight entertainment had been significantly upgraded the only part of the cabin's aesthetics and comfort that was lacking was the overhead lights which had not been replaced the cabin crew was polite professional and accommodating – no complaints there the captain even gave us a personal genuine announcement before takeoff which was appreciated given the amount of preparation necessary before a long nothaul flight the flight itself was comfortable at 6 hours 59 minutes and without delay on either end while i'm a bit concerned that ba is at risk of turning into a low notcost carrier under the current leadership my experience was that his crew are still doing a great job 
 naples to gatwick i used to admire and love ba i now no longer admire it but dislike it and am soon likely to hate it i think that  is entitled to have pleasant expectations when paying the not inconsiderable supplement for flying club europe my wife and i have noticed a constant deterioration over the last two years have complained and received some avios in compensation but this time the cup overfloweth unfortunately not with blessings we had once again  been allocated aisle seats in separate rows even though my wifes preference states that she likes a window seat – and there were plenty of seats adjacent to each other available when we were permitted to make online changes so we did manage to  seats next to each other – but why does ba have to keep doing this the trip as such started well enough in the new ba south terminal lounge which was spacious and had a good selection of drinks food and magazines when time came for boarding and amongst others club europe passengers were invited to board first there was no check made at all which resulted in an almighty scrum as just anybody pushed forward immediately exacerbritish-airwaysted by then having to stand cooped up in the stifling bridge for over 10 minutes as the cleaning of the aircraft had not finished once boarded we were – unlike the other club europe passengers – not offered a glass of water but worst of all and unforgivable found food debris and other dirt in between our seats so much for having to wait for the cleaning to be finished when i opened my meal tray it clearly had not been cleaned as there were crumbs and stains on it we took photographs and also pointed our findings out to the very pleasant stewardess who seemed utterly appalled when she looked the meal was pleasant but we were not offered coffee or tea afterwards and whilst i do not object to being served wine from a large bottle it means  s only a smallish glassful so has to ask for a refill something not everybody likes to do this practice of pouring from a large bottle is clearly a cost notcutting exercise on previous occasions we had been disappointed to find that no lounge facilities for club europe passengers are available in airports like corfu rhodes heraklion even seville contrary to bas website at the time – we were told at all these airports ‘ ba no longer pays for its passengers to have access so this time my wife enquired well in advance whether we  have lounge access in naples she was told no; but at least we knew beforehand – or so we thought but when we got the holding area prior to the gate opening we were joined by some rather merry club europe passengers who told us that there was a lounge though not exclusively for ba use that they had been able to access and enjoy why could the check notin staff not have told us the waiting area did not have sufficient seats but we were lucky and found some however when a young lady arrived to deal with checking boarding cards passengers who were sitting beyond where she stood were forced to  up and move all the way british-airwaysck to the other side club europe passengers were amongst the first to be called so that did not look too british-airwaysd know what we showed our boarding pass then had to stand no seats available in a very cramped area for 14 minutes before the gate was opened in other words we had the doubtful privilege of having to stand for longer than other passengers
 toronto to london heathrow i am a ba exec silver member and paid over £2500 return for business flight as had work straight after flying both journeys  originally was a boeing 787 but they changed planes to an old boeing 777 on both journeys the 'flat' business seat on yyz notlhr was broken and cabin service director could not fix it the bench part was 5 inches different level to main seat extremely uncomfortable and did not sleep a wink no extra pillows available in either business or first food inedible on both journeys outbound fillet of british beef was as tough as old rope they should be ashamed of the business breakfast on the yyz notlhr as i've had better in a greasy joe's cafe also the wine printed on the menu not available on both legs a case of over notpromising and under notdelivering again simply miles behind the competition the csd completed a complaint for me and i also wrote to alex cruz their customer services team offered me £50 in vouchers what planet is he on now they have a very angry and dissatisfied customer it is not the my it is the principle 
 london to montreal i have also flown their economy plus montreal to london and business class  london nottokyo london notrome return ba economy is on a par with ryanair business is okay economy plus is very disappointing with very poor food regardless of class of travel the seats are less comfortable than most of the competition the following is a relatively minor complaint but it was very annoying given that it concerned a thriller i started watching a movie on the flight from montreal to london but the last 15 min of the movie were missing it looked like the recording consisted of only the first 105 min out of 121 min total of the movie in the next few days i tried to see the last part of the movie on other two ba flights business and economy plus and in all cases the final part of the movie was missing in addition to this minor problem all ba flights were plagued by a more serious flaw in the infotainment system: the recording of the safety information was almost inaudible due to a cracking noise once again the same problem applied to all flights
 return flights from newcastle to geneva via london heathrow in club europe check in at newcastle rapid without a queue fast track worked well lounge was ok but limited selection of food onboard all flights the domestic and european biz class is fine seats with decent legroom choice of food chicken salad charcuterie and cheese and good quality drinks the staff were lovely professional and good humoured despite having a lot of service to deliver on short sectors crew from gva notlhr particularly good with a biz passenger who became unwell and needed medical attention on arrival all of this during the mixed fleet strike dates t5 south lounge at lhr was like a sauna and access impossible from south security involves a long walk downstairs then up again north lounge better on return but british-airwaysthrooms generally dirty and in need of an update tagged priority british-airwaysgs were literally the last on the belt at geneva which was a joke but likely not ba's fault first off british-airwaysck in newcastle overall the short haul business product is perfectly adequate if for nothing other than skipping queues ba's lounges are pretty poor compared to some of their competitors but was very happy to see their crew still doing an excellent job
 london to keflavik the british-airways experience has certainly changed i'm happy to pay less and still be treated like the staff are happy to see me and that's not always the case when flying with low cost airlines terminal 5 is  of the best terminals at heathrow and as we were connecting from a long haul flight from asia on another carrier we were a bit tired and travel weary when taking this morning flight but the staff greeted us with a smile the plane felt nice and seat was comfortable it's bring your own entertainment and you'll have to purchase both food and drinks which we found to be comparatively good value for my and quite good i like the ba service touch it manages to be both nice and efficient we had a nice smooth flight home to iceland at the end of our vacation and i can hstly say that i'm looking forward to my next flight with ba
 i was a bit nervous when i booked my bristish airways return flight from london  not tokyo but i had a really pleasant experience the flight attendants were lovely attentive prompt and sweet i'm a nervous flyer so i tend to drink a lot and i never felt judged or like i was bothering them by ordering another the food was good plenty of in notflight movie options and the pilot was very reassuring i'm not really sure what else i could need also the price of the ticket was affordable
 gatwick to mauritius very disappointed to see the decline in quality from ba since i last flew with them for a flight of 115 hours to mauritius i was shocked by the quality of the economy class seats and that ba seriously consider them good enough for a long haul flight of this length possibly the least comfortable airline seat i've ever had with every lump and bump imaginable and the infuriating headrest which does not stay up slipping down and british-airwaysnging you in the neck every 15 minutes the seat british-airwaysck offered no protection from the person behind putting things in their seat pocket legroom also very poor albeit i am above average height but my knees were pressed against the seat in front even before they reclined into me the food was also poor no snacks offered and the meals were slop i have flown air nz virgin emirates and ba in the last two years and ba was the poorest in terms of food and comfort good points: the cabin crew were reasonably good toilets were clean and the in notflight entertainment worked fine with a good selection but that was not enough to save this from being a genuinely poor experience
 boston to barcelona via london i am a silver ba card holder and reserved two flights myself and my wife from boston to london heathrow in premium economy and heathrow to barcelona in economy class i paid for seat reservations for my wife on both legs as she has a bronze card and cannot reserve without paying on check in at boston we were given different seats for the heathrow to barcelona sector than i had reserved in the exit row due to a change of aircraft configuration although the booking was made months before no advance notice was given of the change in early june i applied for a refund of the seat reservation cost and  was given a case number to date there has been no communication or refund from ba in spite of my sending a second email asking for information overall the service onboard and attention to customers has declined significantly over the past year due to cost cutting measures we will not be flying transatlantic with ba in the future after 7 years of several crossings each year in an article about british-airways in the financial times on 2nd june it said that their customers are less and less happy but due to increased earning from cost cutting the shareholders are very happy eventually they may learn that the loss of customers will be more important
 gatwick to mauritius in business class the check in and lounge were of a reasonable standard and the new lounge at gatwick is nice boarding was fine and pre notselected seats retained the layout and features were standard of club world and service of the level expected the club kitchen was fairly limited in its offerings half the entertainment did not work properly if at all in short acceptable service flight left and arrived on time however ba should take note that for this route emirates were less expensive and  have offered an a380 offering on both legs the reason for choosing ba was the fact it was a direct service
 london heathrow to larnaca british-airways was once the flagship airline of the uk you paid a little bit more but the service was always a cut above the rest now they have decided to turn it into a bud airline where you have to pay extra for everything including the highly priced sandwiches  not they even charge for water and if you do not have a card in your pocket you have to go without as they do not take cash i did not mind paying that bit extra for ba flights but now better off with easyjet
 london to hong kong in premium economy i have been flying ba on my many trips over the last six years and i have seen such a shocking decline in their services that i feel compelled to write this review of my six flights this year three were seriously delayed one was from oslo to london on 9th june when the captain decided to wait  for some business class passengers who had not made their way out of the lounge in time for take notoff my worst experience however was going to hong kong on 30th may when there was a technical fault with the plane the captain decided to board passengers at the scheduled time who then sat on the plane for almost three hours without being offered any water or other refreshments and with little information and apologies before an 11 nothour flight i was in premium economy but the extra amount i paid did not offer any additional comfort i switched my seat to help a disabled passenger and ended up in a seat next to the toilets which meant that i got no rest during the night how can premium economy seats be next to the toilet the in notflight service was poor as nobody came around to offer water or beverages during the night i am still wondering why anybody  pay for premium economy as it is just a lousy offer: seats are only marginally more spacious than in economy but do not recline as they  in economy the food is the same which means rather british-airwaysd and the flight attendants are clearly not interested in offering service beyond the first two hours of the flight predictably the plane landed in hong kong just in time below three hours' delay for the airline avoiding to have to pay compensation to passengers on this very uncomfortable flight i had hoped to have a better experience on the return flight on 4th june but then i found out that ba had scrapped the sparkling wine as a welcome drink for premium economy passengers although this time the flight was on time this gave me such a british-airwaysd feeling about ba their cynical attitude towards their passengers and their meanness i will look for alternative airlines from now on and  recommend to avoid flying with ba
 belfast to munich via heathrow today 4th july i found i needed to change a travel date from 7th july to 6th july  i attempted to do this on ba's manage my booking for about 2 hours and although i selected 4 different flight times each time i thought my booking change was completed at an extra cost of £156 not199 + seat costs i was told that my changed flights were fully booked even though my booking included purchase of seats shown as available quite a few so i contacted ba's customer services by ph and waited for about 20 minutes for an agent who after saying hello and providing his name promptly lost me so another 20 minutes later i spoke to another very caring and helpful ba agent and she told me the only available flight changes  cost me almost +£500 onto my £218 ticket i could have booked a new return ticket for a lot less i am hugely unimpressed by the additional charge by ba when all the work is by me and on notline and ba can re notsell my friday flight; the time i spent going around in circles online to end up with nothing and having to ph customer services; and  the time it takes to  though to customer services who clearly are insufficiently staffed over notworked and with limited capacity to really help ba  not you are in serious need of a makeover and self notexamination to have customers such as i consider using you again and not tell every to avoid you and write reviews such as this
 london heathrow to tallinn return flight on time on way out had changed seats to row 12 emergency loads of legroom and row in front ca not recline so it was very comfortable bought a nondescript coffee good flight the flight home was a surprise using a qatar airways plane and crew due to ba strike row 12 not an emergency row but more legroom than is standard on ba a better seat on a new plane a decent free snack and a nice small bottle of wine also free so a good experience wake up ba
 london heathrow to barcelona i thought it  be better than a low cost airline but it is not in fact it is quite worse so if you have a cheaper option do not hesitate to go with them the flight is full and they say you can only take on board a british-airwaysckpack to put under your seat but not the british-airwaysg trolley rude people and ridiculous rules a company living in the past century
 dubrovnik to gatwick poor ground service chaotic boarding via airport bus no greeting or assistance on boarding from cabin staff the shoddy service which has become the ba norm forced to fly ba by tour operator  other wise have chosen a alternative airline most food choices for purchase were not available tea was lukewarm and not pleasant cabin staff rude and unhelpful a most unpleasant flight
 stockholm to london heathrow shabby third party lounge in stockholm very tired 767 aircraft buy on board service took ages crew were funny raising an eyebrow at ba's new low cost carrier concept in europe with the expensive buy a sandwich on notboard ba are  rung about ryanair and on par with easyjet when it comes to customer service and delivery such a shame what's happened to them convenient flight times and lhr departure is as good at it s i'm afraid
 london to dubrovnik interesting that ba have dropped the to fly to serve advert boarding was the usual unorganised shambles selling hand luggage only tickets only adds to the scrum in trying to place a modest size british-airwaysg in the overheads no less than three couples came on with oversized british-airwaysgs in  instance it took 3 people to lift a british-airwaysg into the overheads coming dangerously close to dropping the british-airwaysg onto to the heads of seated passangers when complaints were made to cabin crew the response was they are entitled to bring hand luggage the trolley sales of refreshments took an inordinate time most of the choices were unavailable cabin crew frequently gave the wrong orders and had great difficulty with the automated card payment system would strongly recommend taking own food on ba short haul flights
 flew accra to london heathrow all was going well which in accra means an orderly boarding got to the end of the runway when the pilot announced that we  be returning to the stand as there was a discrepancy on the cargo load i assume more loaded than was on the manifest the takeoff was terminated seconds before the engines started their job this then took an hour to sort out with cargo being removed  not no drinks offered this was business class i reminded myself once off the flight was the standard british-airways club world product nothing special or memorable but at least was not full so the reaching over the dividing screen to serve did not have to happen tired business class product old and tired plane i wish ba  at least try and not show the interior is patched toher with masking tape and something that looks like grouter that you  use in a british-airwaysthroom the crew do not really have much to offer now in terms of product although they were professional if not friendly must be terrible working for ba now knowing that the product is so inferior to other international carriers the inflight entertainment is dire  not for regular travellers only the addition of  or two new films with the rest of the chose the same month after month the memento of this night flight has not changed for years  not it is surely due a refresh
 london heathrow to stockholm newish aircraft nice leather seats but very cramped nice leather seats had emergency exit which was fine but others were very tight ba is now akin to a low cost carrier in europe do not expect much and you wont be disappointed really is no different to flying easyjet these days
 malta to gatwick this is for british-airways catering service managers they have invested a lot of time and my into your meal scheme so as to earn extra income rather than give free meals initially i was very impressed when i spied the m&s food and drink menu which does merit appreciation however on flight ba 2645 from malta to gatwick my initial feelings of happiness were swiftly gutted i am a strict vearian so i was happy to see the selection of vearian fayre but unfortunately by the time the trolley got to me a long time i might add there was no veggie sandwiches no veggie focaccia not even mixed nuts for heavens sake of course there was plenty for the non notvearians not only that but the couscous salad has chicken on it but no veggie alternative i was very disappointed and ba need to do better for me to fly with ba again i'd need some assurances that they will care just as much for the veggie people as for the meatheads 
 london to zagreb british-airways lost my luggage on the 20th june and here i am on the 30th still trying to  some information we came across the most ridiculous customer service agent on the 21st who advised us we were unauthorised to be enquiring about the claim because we were not providing the correct information when we asked him what information was incorrect he  not proceed with our call on the 6th day when we were british-airwaysck at the airport to fly out we were told that the british-airwaysg was delivered to our temporary address the day before what a mess we were told that they  try to  it on the last flight and that they  call us when we arrived at heathrow we went to the customer service desk to ask where we could  some information and the lady  not even let us in the line because 'there is no such thing as a place to follow up missing luggage if you make a claim you need to just wait for a ph call i never heard from any we are british-airwaysck home now in australia and i have just called to follow up the british-airwaysg to which i was advised that the claim has been closed now i need to wait for the claim to be reopened and wait another 72hrs to  an update not once have we received a call from any our ph bill is over $800aus due to the amount of calls we had to make i suggest british-airways take a good hard look at how you treat your customers who spend a hell of a lot of my to fly with your airline and take in to some consideration how you  feel being on the other side of the world with no luggage for 10 days absolutely disgraceful
 manchester to philadelphia i booked my flights through british-airways but the flights were american airlines i booked a gluten free meal both ways using the field in the booking form that ba had provided when the meals came round i was told that ba had not passed on my dietary requirements and all they could offer me was a small salad half a tomato and some lettuce when i landed i emailed british-airways to complain and ask them to ensure i had a gluten free meal on my return i received no reply and again there was no food for me on the flight after countless emails i finally received a message telling me that even though british-airways had a field on their form to ask for my dietary requirements i should have contacted american airlines to request it british-airways apparently pick and choose which information they send to the carrier airlines i told them that they should not ask for information that they do not intent to pass on but was met with the same 'you should have requested it better' line they are truly incompetent at  point they started talking about my child  not which i do not have 0/10 for customer service
 just landed from the second of two flights in first between london and kuala lumpur and on both legs the experience was exceptional chose seats 1e and 1f on both legs for my partner and i and seats were clean well maintained fully functioning and very comfortable ground service at t5 is a vast improvement with the new first wing; passed through quickly and met by attentive staff with prompt and professional service in the concorde room golden lounge at kuala lumpur less inspiring but staff very good and nice dinner menu onboard the staff on both legs were professional friendly intuitive attentive and good natured and they went out of their way to accommodate our dining requests flowers in the british-airwaysthroom which was kept clean though a second british-airwaysthroom  be helpful as had to wait at times and amuse bouche provided plenty of wine no shortage of food and nothing ran out  not my glass was never empty and the crew knew when to make the bed up without having to ask these flights reminded of why we fly with ba and remain loyal to them
 frankfurt to london heathrow three british-airwaysgs belonging to self and colleague checked 26 june at frankfurt on the 1720 flight to london 25 hrs before flight flight arrived in london 40 mins late and 1 of 3 british-airwaysgs appeared on carousel a business flight with virtually no checked british-airwaysggage on it courteous customer service personnel in baggage hall took details  not noted that baggage had not been loaded promised that british-airwaysgs  be sent on first flight the next day and should be delivered to our office by 1200 noon nothing and still waiting for delivery at 1510 three days later how and why 1 out of 3 delivered and why 48 hours for delivery
british-airways business class heathrow to accra as the bbc reported the most delay notafflicted route 85 out of 122  not or 70%  not of flights on this route were delayed by over 30 minutes last summer as a regular on this route i can verify these unacceptable delays indeed my flight the delay was as usual over an hour the club world product is now very tired and worn  not no updates to it despite the constant updates by other carriers the ba crew were fine but not given good enough product tools to outshine other airlines usual chaotic boarding process for this flight  not the airlines knows it will have issues with hand luggage but always board the plane with only thirty minutes to departure it will never work on this routing when will ba learn the seating in the usual ba format for business class is just not keeping up with other airlines  not including one world members like qatar american or royal jordanian the constant having to lower the divider between seats to serve is both rude and poor service the comfort is now more akin to ethiopian airlines on their older aircraft rather than that expected of ba the lhr notacc notlhr route is a my maker for ba  not they use their old and tired aircraft on the route and milk it for all it is worth air france and klm probritish-airwaysbly offer a better business class service on this route a great shame to see  of the previously great airlines go down and down in standard
 london heathrow to seattle i havent even taken this flight yet and i am totally disillusid i have flown with british-airways 3 times out of manchester and on each occasion the aircraft has had technical problems and this has caused me to miss my long haul connecting flight on this occasion i have decided to drive down to london heathrow to avoid this issue and now there will be a strike i telephd ba customer service today to ask about the laptop situation after pressing many buttons i was informed all the lines are busy and cut off i will never book a flight with ba again even if this means i have a long layover or connection time this airline is a national disgrace and the british flag should be removed from the livery if i  on the flight i will let you know how it is
 on the 13th june 2017 i travelled from mykonos to london heathrow on ba 651 if british airways are trying to compete with bud airlines they are failing dismally we were two hours into a four hour flight before the refreshment trolley reached us only to be informed that there were no sandwiches left for us to purchase all we were offered was a packet of peanuts or a packet of two biscuits this flight left around lunchtime and i  have thought it  be obvious there  be a large demand for something to eat to add to the problems of no refreshment being available there was only  card machine in operation if there is going to be a no cash policy then make sure your staff have the tools to work with i have today received a teleph call from ba following my initial complaint which really served no purpose it was a case of sorry but we are working to improve the service which does not help me a service which was very good before the cost cutting  'we fly to serve' i somehow do not think so anymore easy jet ryanair and other bud airlines must be clapping their hands with joy as they will benefit from this shambles i cannot imagine flying with ba again
 i was flying british-airwaysck from zurich to heathrow after a visit to see my son we arrived in time at the airport check in was quick and friendly but once we got through security the trauma of ba began a 2 hour delay on the screen why did not they tell us at check notin yes they did know as it transpired the flight had a problem earlier in the day once the boarding began all was okay until we got on  of bas old planes with the most sullen crew you could ever meet no welcome the seats were hard and uncomfortable before taking off the captain explained the delay had been due to a faulty door the door had now been decommissid as not for use and hence some seats were empty a strange explanation and comforting for any who had a fear of flying when the food service came i was asleep but my said they ignored her when we did arrive at heathrow t5 we ended up at the c gates so adding another 20 minutes or so based on this i will no longer pick ba as a preference the brand once the favourite airline is no longer 
 rome to heathrow flight on the 23rd june delayed take off over 6 hours due to technical fault minimal information and absolutely no customer service or support no refreshments provided the only information we received was when the captain came of the aircraft to tell us what was happening he was the only  who cared ba support and service in rome was non existent after take off the cabin crew came around with their trolley of drinks and unbelievably i had to pay £230 for a cup of tea despite a 6 delay with no refreshments provided ba is now an overpriced bud airline with no service focus actually thats unfair to bud airlines who provide much better service ba has lost the plot
 chennai to london what a mistake i selected this route for a two reasons i wanted to try the new british-airways 787 in club class and the timing but i have nothing good to say about the whole thing the lounge at chennai was poor but at least it was near the gate once aboard the plane we discovered that instead of what i think should be standard in business class there is no direct aisle access for the window seats and if you're in the aisle seat you'll have people climbing over your legs to access the aisle and the hostess leaning over you to serve the person in the window seat the layout is quite crazy the seats themselves are fairly standard business class arrangements but its how ba have crammed them all in that's the issue i had the window seat and initially i found it ok but as it was a very long all daytime flight i had to dim the window and that's the point you can only dim them down there is no blind the sun still shines through ok i accept it's like looking through very dark sun glasses but it's not possible to cut out the light as you  with blinds i understand several other airlines are retro fitting blinds on the 787 but this is a major error by boeing it was my second flight on a 787 both were 11 hour plus flights the earlier  i made was at night so no issue with the window blinds i've not noticed any advantage in the higher pressure of the aircraft i find myself just as tired after a flight as i  be on any other aircraft i'm a long term supporter of ba and i'm so upset that ba are going british-airwaysckwards focusing on profits and ripping off the customer sorry ba but there are so many good airlines out there competing for your business please wake up and start delivering service to customers not just cram them in and take the my because it wo not last people like me will move on
 flew london gatwick to genoa with british-airways fast check in at the smart new premium area at gatwick brand new lounge was really comfortable and with a great selection of food drink and magazines access to the lounge not very convenient but given the design of the terminal i realize that nothing can be d about that the gate number was only announced 20 minutes prior to the gate closing and it was 20 minutes away at at fast pace especially as there was a queue to exit the lounge by the two elevators on board our club europe seats that we had paid extra to choose something that no other airline that i know of does with a full business class fare was behind the curtain overhead bins were full so ourselves and another 2 club europe passengers had to put their british-airwaysgs further british-airwaysck in the economy cabin without assistance an engineer was called to try to move the divider and curtain british-airwaysck but it was stuck and remained between rows 2 and 3 with our seats being in row 3 my special meal was not on board however the crew member in the premium cabin was very obliging and a crew meal was provided for the short flight leg room was atrocious for business class and seats are the same as economy because the curtain could not be drawn the business class toilet was used by economy class passengers and at times business passengers had to queue behind them given the high expectations following the experience on the ground the plane was not up to standard however the service provided despite these lapses was great had to wait for about 20 minutes for british-airwaysgs despite being the only aircraft at genoa airport in all this was not a business class quality flight we should have flown economy for a quarter of the price
" 
flew british-airways from beijing to london heathrow the cabin crew did their best but they know they are now providing a very inferior product compared to other carriers cut british-airwayscks are evident everywhere from the small and very cheap hot towels offered only once during the ten hours flight and the nuts presented in a packet other than with other airlines on china and warm  not this might seem a small niggle but it is indication of ba saves costs  not by annoying their premium cabin customer the amenity kits presented in a shoe british-airwaysg is a joke really to be hst  s a better premium cabin product from other one world members royal jordanian and qatar for example flight left and arrived on time  not but the airline should be more than that the offering within the flight needs to be competitive and regain some ground was presented at the second meal serice with frozen pawns on bread returned and a de notfrosted plate came by return unsure if prawns being frozen and unfrozen as a good idea  not but no effect as yet part of the seat was covered with food from the previous flight i covered it up with a spare blanket despite there being enough toilets for club world passengers there was often a line of people waiting from world traveller plus  not snaking past seat in rows 15 and 16 no control of passengers from world traveller plus coming in to the club world cabin toilets were not cleaned through the flight by crew  not twice they were in a bit of state so i ended up cleaning the floor with tissues myself lovely shame to see  of the great carriers fall to such low levels"
 flew british-airways from corfu to london heathrow food service a joke i have never written a review on anything in my life but how can an airline like british-airways spend probritish-airwaysbly millions of pounds setting up a new food paying service by using an antiquated system of the poor cabin staff needing to find each individual item picture on the hand held computer and check they have entered the correct number of items instead of using british-airwaysrcodes unbelievable if the company has become so british-airwaysdly managed how many quangos to come up with this decision that common sense is lost in corporate nonsense apart from that flight great but sorry ba please admit your mistake and put this right 
 heathrow to santorini we were at the gate when ba cancelled our flight we could not  booked on another flight and we got told to go home without our luggage it took them 4 days to return it ba will not reimburse us the cost of the flights at £1200 or the cost of the hotel at £2000 this is a total disgrace how can they be allowed to do that book with another airline to ensure you actually arrive never experienced such british-airwaysd customer service and refusing to refund our my is outrageous
 leeds to durbritish-airwaysn via london / johannesburg check in at leeds was efficient security was slow so fast track was appreciated boarding was relatively quick and flight departed early seating was reasonably comfortable but cramped and service is british-airwayssically non existent unless  is prepared to pay for food transfer at heathrow was a breeze surprisingly with no further security check boarding commenced in good time and was quick and smooth onto the upper deck with a pleasant greeting from the crew the premium economy cabin is very pleasant with good seat width and legroom the seats are comfortable but both our seats were faulty mine  not stay upright and my wife's  not recline unfortunately we did not realise the extent of the problem immediately and only reported it next morning we were moved to business class  not we should have reported it immediately sparkling wine and fruit juice were offered before take off unfortunately the quality has been hit by cost savings bar service followed quickly after take off but again the quality of wines was average and not up to the standard offered by other airline in premium economy we both ordered beef fillet for dinner  not alternative was chicken  not which was good and served on proper crockery with decent cutlery breakfast next morning was economy class fare with plastic cutlery which along with the cheap and nasty amenity kit lets down the standard and  questions whether the cost saving is really worth the negative impression created the a380 is very quiet and most passengers seemed to sleep there were several drink runs during the night and the cabin crew were quite active arrival was on time and everything went smoothly the final connection to durbritish-airwaysn with ba franchise comair was a reminder of the difference between flying in south africa and flying in europe more space and full service on a  hour flight
 i had an early morning flight from london heathrow to dublin to attend a memorial service in ireland the check notin process seems to have been automated and i am not impressed i saw an elderly chinese couple struggle with the computers and a uniformed staff member in ba uniform walked away and ignored them i intervened and assisted the interior of the aircraft was spotless however there was no catering per se other than a to buy marks and spencer items no cash was accepted and the staff were very embritish-airwaysrrassed the cabin crew were lovely people and deserve better than to have the name of a once proud national carrier reduced to such a miserly product arrival was punctual
 bangkok to luxembourg via london premium economy on british-airways is disappointing the bangkok to london route is served by b777 aircraft that look like they've seen better days boarding was chaotic on both outward and return flights seats are old and worn not very wide and with little recline the ife is poor in terms of choice the screens are the smallest i've ever seen and the sound quality is very british-airwaysd the food served is ok service on board during the outward leg was perfunctory but excellent on the return leg with the cabin attendant who served me being a real credit and asset to the airline the short haul flights between london and luxembourg in economy were good it's time for british-airways to pull up its socks if it wants to compete with the leading asian middle eastern airlines or even the better european s
 london heathrow to paris orly i have been a gold member of ba over 25 years making approx 100 flights per year we have been through ash clouds strikes it breakdowns and weather and of late the spiral of poor response has picked up pace i didnt think it could  worse but it did arrived at the airport and my app said on time screens said on time but my independent tracking app said 3 hours delay in the first class lounge i was told short delay knowing how inaccurate ba can be i asked to speak to special services one hour later i asked again i got an arrogant manager who lectured me that she was only two on duty take it up with alex cruz and there were more important flyers like royalty and celebrity unimportant is how i felt after 25 years of gold guest list she then told me the flight was cancelled and said i  have to either accept the flight the next morning or make my own arrangement staff didnt know how to  people out of the airport and despte flights on time for charles de gaulle no alternative was offered i had to concede and cancelled critical business discussion and then beg ba for a refund which they tried to sidestep the moral of this story is when your gut tells you trust has g believe it and at ba it is systemic lack of hsty and transparency and it all points to the ceo the other interesting fact is i did look at choices before booking including easy jet <100 pounds air france 500 pounds and foolishly i felt loyalty meant something not at this airlin  the salt in the wound is that easyjet and af got to their destination on time and no doubt executives on those flights are enjoying a good business day in france it is incredible that  airline who carry's the british flag is such a disgrace i am sure that a small percentage are satisfied but looking at the chaos and disbelief in the lounge last night echoes the most common phrase heard in airline speak what has happened to ba and we wont fly them again
 flew new york jfk to copenhagen via heathrow have flown premium economy pe on cathay singapore lufthansa and air france by far british-airways is the worst world traveler plus just means plus $$$$$ everything else is downhill seats were cramped recline only a few millimeters food awful sorry but that is the best adjective to describe what was served amenities practically non notexistent and wrapped in cellophane tube of toothpaste if only the cap  open could only fulfill brushing requirements for half a mouthful of teeth no covers for the headphs totally inadequate for the my paid and shaming the word premium economy before i for the boarding service was confusing calling colors gold silver sapphire etc people just rushing the line and the staff losing their voice screaming for order why not just call the way you sell  not first biz premium economy trying too hard to be fancy
" flew london to hamburg i cannot believe that an airline like british-airways have to compete with the likes of ryanair and easyjet and stopped complimentary cabin services  not no drinks no snacks they should be ashamed of themselves to put themselves a class on par with low cost airlines  i am now cofused why i should ever fly british-airways vs low cost airlines i was recently also flying on club world my luggage was tagged priority but waited on arrival for over 30mins  not non priority british-airwaysgs came out mixed with priority  not british-airways policies and operations are clearly confused and it's losing its edge as a world reknowned airline

 british-airways charges a big premium for premium economy i sat on the top floor of the a380 after being upgraded from world traveller at the gate and enjoyed an aisle seat flying from singapore to london heathrow there were two dinner options chicken tikka or beef fillet but as i dozed off i missed out so no food until 1 hour before landing 11 hours later unless i wanted to pay for chocolates with a credit card i kindly asked for some water got some orange juice too  not did not want to push it even though i saw a bottle of champagne open in the galley  not not worth the risk of a british-airwaysd reaction i cannot recommend this cabin british-airwayssed on the high prices they charge the staff mean well  not however a gulf of enthusiasm exists between them an singapore airlines qatar cathay etc it's not cultural it's just indifference will continue to book ba for cheap economy product/service offers almost no difference and enjoy upgrades where given
" singapore to london i have started to take british-airways as it's a corporate requirement the business class club world is more like premium economy the seats are small and uncomfortable especially with the layout for the passenger sitting next to the window  not you are british-airwayssically trapped inside and you'd have to disturb the other passenger to  out furthermore the bed does not extend fully so it uses creatively a makeshift fold down stool  not if you apply too much pressure on that stool it unlocks itself and seem to break off from the latch  not it's just flimsy the food is very low quality and tatstes bland  not i have already tried the regular meal and special meals  not do not bother the service is poor with a crew that is  not bothered to provide for the comfort of business class passengers overall i am very disappointed

 this was my first flight from toronto to london crewed by mixed fleet easy check notin at toronto pearson the ba ground staff are always great in toronto with fast track meant i was in the lounge 20 mins after arriving at the airport the lounge remains well run with ok food and a limited average wine list still too few british-airwaysthrooms the seats are tatty and when busy is not a relaxing place to be easy boarding and the first of a few improvements  not prosecco now served to london used to be only ex london fast drinks service after take off with pretzels now british-airwaysck on offer an ok chicken curry was served but i still do not see it as biz class food a choice of whites and reds wine was offered which reinstates the previous  of each that is where the improvements ended the morning offering of a cereal british-airwaysr and t&cs / juice remains an insult and just shows how little ba care about the entire journey customer experience the crew on this flight were great young junior and inexperienced for sure but the two women working my side were friendly and professional a request for a top up of prosecco was missed due to a short taxi but appeared in glass without asking as soon as the crew were released  not classy and well remembered the return flight was less good drinks served promptly after take off and my pre notbooked meal arrived first but on the wrong tray crew member's first flight since qualifying it took some convincing that the plastic cutlery etc was not a wtp tray the underwhelming snack replacing the second meal was  fun size piece of chocolate and t&c customers taking a second chocolate were made to put it british-airwaysck really as apparently they are counted out to the exact number of passengers this cut to service on both legs continues to leave me troubled as after 5 hours i need something more substantial than chocolate service reduced  not yes price reduced  not no the 777's in both directions were clean though unless you sit in the first row of wtp the ife screens are tiny mixed fleet were generally more friendly and interested in making an effort however the male crew were more aloof lacked attention to detail and officious what these newer crews miss was the more informal / laid british-airwaysck service of long haul crew  not i hope they relax into the role soon at least the cuts have stopped not much left to cut i admit and small things like choice of wine and pretzels show ba have listened however the second meal in both directions being cut on east coast us / canada routes remains a sore on what was otherwise an ok journey the jury remains out on whether i continue my loyalty to ba and one world  not it really depends on what ba do next  not to either value me as a customer and offer a quality service or sink even lower in standards from what was once a great airline at which point  not i'm off
 i arrived at london heathrow in transit with a british-airways flight on to another ba flight the aircraft was there still boarding my british-airwaysg was checked notin for my final destination but i was not they forgot to check me in for my full journey at departure they did not let me board and made me stay overnight i have never seen such level of stupidity british-airwaysd management and poor service
the crews on both the outbound and inbound flights from johannesburg to london were very young unprofessional and were missing the special character and wit that used to make the british-airways crews special and outstanding they were british-airwayssically on both flights rushing through the service and not to be seen for the next 8 hours before the breakfast service on both flights there was no water offered during the night which is really a shame considered the price difference between economy and premium the meals were overcooked and on both flights the knives could not cut through the best of british beef given that the hot meals are the same than in club according to ba's marketing i  have been furious if being offered this quality of food in business class a perfect example of unprofessionalism of the crew was when i got up after dinner and went to the galley as nobody cared to answer the bell and asked for a baileys: the young attendant looked at her coworker and asked her what a baileys was and the answer came sorry sir we do not have that kind of wine would you like some white i am missing the good old ba and will take my business to some other reputable airlines in the future even if it means paying a few hundreds more
 flew valencia to london gatwick with british-airways check in was a bit disorganised as the check in for business class had a problem with the computer so this caused a delay security was a bit slow no fast track business class lounge is quite large but refreshments poor note this is not a ba lounge as they only have  flight a day and is provided by a local partner boarding was a disaster we were called to board but then waited on the air notbridge for over 20 minutes the air notbridge was made of glass and was full of people and it soon became very uncomfortable as there was no ac or ventilation and some people seemed close to passing out eventually we all returned to the terminal as there was a problem on the plane apparently a problem with the curtain structure that divides business from economy there was no communication from the ground staff which although not ba staff reflects british-airwaysdly on the airline once we were finally on notboard the flight was trouble free good service hot meals served but the pasta we chose was not very pleasant plane arrived only 10 minutes late having made up a lot of time from the initial delay priority british-airwaysggage worked as our case was on the carousel as soon as cleared passport control would have been a nice trip british-airwaysck british-airwaysr the problems in valencia airport
 london heathrow to edinburgh return possibly my last ba flights i used economy or maybe should be re named economy minus outbound and returned in club europe checked in online however 4 of the 5 checking in kiosks were not working at t5 so in the end collected the boarding pass from the desk security quick i'm a ba/oneworld sapphire member so used the north lounge which was okay flight boarded on time but departed 15 min late and arrived 15 min late a320 seat 11a an exit seat was fine however no service at all on board return check in quick as was security the ba lounge in edi has been the same for a few years now it's at least quiet with nice staff and pleasant staff boarding through gate 20 on to a pretty old 767 departed 30 min late club europe on domestic flights is a new introduction actually it replaced what was ba economy class a cynical ploy by the ba board to extract more my out of its loyal customers the aircraft was pretty full so some people like ba although i suspect many passengers were transferring at lhr service was okay food economy standard although included in the price arrival at t5 around 30 min late 10 min for british-airwaysgs i fly between 20 & 30 times each year 90% on long haul flights i have supported ba in the past although i've not used them long haul for about 17 months basically they are not good enough cut british-airwayscks and poor service is evident i expect security comfort and some service when paying £2500+ for a business class ticket qatar cathay and even srilankan offer better service on reflection i fly business class on most flights so i do not actually need any frequent flyer status the cost of loyalty outweighs the benefits i might fly ba in future as a very last resort or to use up the miles i've earned but my loyalty will be my wallet in future bye ba
 london to valencia in an a319 in club europe this was the first time we had flown british-airways since the move to the south terminal check in was quick and progress through security also without delay ba lounge was busy but still plenty of seating available refreshments in the lounge ok but nothing special boarding on time cabin crew in club europe were very pleasant and efficient as i always find with ba meal service surprisingly good for a relatively short flight three courses quite tasty including smoked salmon starter thyme roasted chicken for main course and chocolate cheesecake washed down with a couple of glasses of champagne note ba no longer use miniature bottle and pour as required from proper sized bottles cheese and crackers a bit sad and the cracker were soft plane landed ahead of schedule but priority british-airwaysggage did not work and our cases was about the last through overall a good flight
 brussels to rome via london there are no substantial differences to the service offered by a low notcost airline: no free food/beverage little leg space choice of seets only for extra payment etc however the price i paid was at a low notcost level as well so the value for my is ok
 awful cost cutting beyond belief dirty aircraft uncomfortable seats inflight entertainment is something that  have existed in the 80s has been the same for several years no meal choice meat either  meat or veg half empty cabin across the entire flight ran out of alcohol too ba have and are continuing to cost cut but they have not cut their prices to reflect this i  seriously fly some else enough is enough you've had my 15 years of loyalty silver exec club member or not i'm off  not and will advise others to do the same i cannot give a 0 out of 10 the 1 is purely for the cabin crew who are embritish-airwaysrrassed by what is now bud airways
 london heathrow to madrid an absolute third world experience once i got on the plane check notin and lounge experience were great but once i got onboard it became obvious how clapped out some of the 767 aircraft are there were seats with missing british-airwayscks and 'do not occupy' covers in front and beside them random bits of electrical wiring hanging down from rails in the overhead and grimy yellowed staining around most of the cabin interior you have to worry about what's going on the important bits like the engines if the same standard is applied outside the aircraft as in the cabin the crew spent as much time as they could in the galley and interacted with passengers as little as possible the breakfast service was a salt notinfused hot cooked offering and just  run of drinks anything else you wanted you had to use the call button the  and only reason i booked this cabin was that it was actually just a few pounds more expensive on the overall ticket routing i'd bought
 gatwick to alicante my wife my son 4 and me all flew ba euro club on our way to alicante for some reason when booking club it was the same price as normal so it was a no brainer my son has autism so we found the quite lounge amazing way to start our trip as he was very calm before the staff at ba were very friendly before and on the plane which was a nice touch club euro is a decent service if you pay a little extra the lounge is a nice start then the extra service is nice on the plane its a shame like all the other reviews point out the seats are the same it  be nice to have slightly more legroom
 gatwick to antigua a frequent flyer with ba for over 15 years silver exec club i have seen the steadily decline of this airline particularly over the past 18 months / alex cruz take over my partner and i fly regularly in eco/prem and club depending on prices so have seen the decline across all classes recent trip to antigua from lgw was awful a pretty empty cabin filthy is not the word awful in flight entertainment rockwell that has not changed in 10 years easily food choice is no longer a choice its a meat dish or veg alcoholic beverages are loaded at origin lgw for both legs so they have now halved what they usually stocked previously 3 hours into flight there was no spirits left  not bearing in mind only  drink had been served prior to the meal service 15 hours in to the flight ba state in their motto to fly to serve yes they certainly are flying but most certainly not serving the cabin crew are ashamed and embritish-airwaysrrassed at the cuts which is evident in their conversations at the british-airwaysck of the aircraft and to any who speaks to them they are disgusted with what the bosses have d they have cheapened the brand of the national carrier but have not cheapened their prices easyjet and ryanair offer superior and on long haul its got to the point i will now fly virgin and others again offer more for your my in all aspects of the flight stop trying to make ba bud we want it british-airwaysck to how it used to be all i can say is the compensation passengers will be receiving following the major it glitch a fortnight ago is  way of paying customers british-airwaysck for the awful attitude and decline in british-airways
london city to milan the price of the ticket about £500 for a 2 hour flight  not had no relationship to the ultra noteconomy service on this flight the aircraft was very dirty  not i wonder whether ba pays for fewer cleaners as other airlines do not seem to have filthy aircraft in business the seats are identical to economy so what are we actually paying for there is no place to power devices and for wifi or overhead screens in business the food was an awful english breakfast no better than economy the embritish-airwaysrrassed flight attendants seemed to give all the business passengers champagne to take notaway to try and make up for the no notfrills service it feels chronic under investment for years has left this a british-airwaysre notbs airline milking short notterm profits and forting that their business model should be more than just for 1 year
 flown economy premium boston notlondon heathrow notgeneva again as too often with british-airways nowadays flight left more than an hour late due to a plane technical problem as a consequence our connecting flight in lhr was missed had to wait for 5 hours at lhr although there were earlier flights since our late arrival was known by ba at least 5 hours in advance why did not they at least pre notbook our connecting flight from lhr long queues at rebooking desk very little care of customers then again flight from lhr left late breakfast on board long haul miserable service on board short haul now equals those of charter flights although i have been travelling with ba for 25 years with silver and gold status i will avoid flying with ba again and for sure let know around me that this airline is even not a shadow of what it used to be
 gatwick to bordeaux awful newish a320 cramped seats the new buy onboard from m&s does not work it takes the cabin crew the entire flight to work just about the whole economy cabin with some people not even ting served at least easyjet and ryanair have this down to a tee and serve promptly ba has g downhill and nothing but sad customers and embritish-airwaysrrassed cabin crew ba certainly is not cutting prices of flights ryanair and easyjet offer many similar routes with half the price as ba i know where i will be taking my custom in future 
 london to boston return in premium economy another very disappointing flight experience with ba overall a low cost experience at a premium price baggage drop in t5 is now self service unless you fly business or first which feels like easyjet lounge was very busy and choice of food very limited  the plane was a 23 year old b747 which seemed to be in its original or close to original configuration the screen in the seat in front of my was the size of my iph and the choice of movies was very limited the cabin crew was friendly and did their best to operate in horrible conditions food was not edible i tried the beef option but could not eat it what i found truly shocking was the snack in morning of the return leg was nothing more than a muesli british-airwaysr in premium economy  notcost savings taken to ridiculous levels at ba they have even managed to find a way to economise on the quality of the sleep mask supplied no more cotton or other skin friendly material on the inside but awful full nylon / polyester material and only  instead of two straps on british-airwaysck i am taking my business elsewhere and only use ba to spent the avios
 istanbul to london on a reasonably priced airfare check notin experience was quite good with friendly staff member at istanbul airport who took my portable ph charger from me departure lounge was a bit chaotic due to the laptop british-airwaysn and checking each passenger's british-airwaysg manually on board was average to say the least in fact it was surprising and a bit disappointing that on british-airways the passengers have to pay for food and drink nice products but very overpriced also there was no inflight entertainment and the cabin crew were indifferent the seats on the a320 were also quite hard and uncomfortable the whole product offering is not good compared to other competing airlines on this route who have wifi on many flights food and drink ife the experience was more like a low cost carrier i do not think i'll bother to fly them again unless i have to
 london to mumbritish-airwaysi terrible customer service i have benn trying to change my flight with them for the last three days and they keep blaming the travel agent even through the ticket was issued by ba after the meltdown on the 27th if you  through to their india call center you might as welll hang up the ph as they are rude and all they will do is keep blaming the third party will inturpt you when you are trying to speak just awful service agree british airways is going downhill been a silver member for many years need to look for another provider just awful customer service which ba wo not care to look into
" i am a frequent flyer with british-airways having held silver membership for years on this instance i flew ba's short nothaul business class while you're essentially in the same cabin as every else you should  a meal onboard something i had counted on and the seat next to you should be left empty i fly this route around once every other week but have been ba to long nothaul destinations hong kong beijing nyc dc and san francisco several times a year my experience on this flight tallies with the other flights i have taken this year on the same and other routes the aircraft came in late which is a common occurrence with ba these days except for me nobody in business class had an empty seat next to them we were then informed by the overworked and tired flight attendant that no food had been delivered although we 'might be' able to obtain food vouchers once we  to lcy in short the product was exactly the same as economy class but at an added premium of at least the price of your regular economy ticket this was complemented by slow and unfriendly check notin staff an old aircraft and a good hour i had spent on the ph with unaccountable and disinterested ba customer service to work out if the online upgrade had g through on the whole a number of instances that simply add up make me feel that ba is very much going in the wrong direction they might be cheap but ca not and should not compete with low notcost carriers or indeed asian airlines that have lower overhead costs

" my wife and i were very disappointed with our british-airways flights from sydney to london return flying premium economy the food quality cutlery and service was of a much lower standard than other airlines such as air new zealand and qantas that we have used there are no toilets allocated for the cabin and are located at the middle of the economy cabin quite a long walk and at times a very long line of other passengers waiting to use them the seats are a bit more comfortable and spacious than economy class the entertainment viewing screen is ok as are the films music and earphs ba do not offer priority check in at airports as do other airlines we  not fly with ba premium economy again it is not worth paying the much more expensive fare than the standard economy fare

 london to hong kong on a very new b777 not300er i was upgraded to wt+ at the gate owing to a full flight and probritish-airwaysbly being an emerald with world i can now distil the difference in service/product with economy on the same route  not with wt+ you will receive  amenity pack eyeshades socks toothbrush  welcome drink cava or water  glass for drinking with the first meal a slightly wider seat 1 inch minor extra recline 1 inch and a little extra legroom as well as a meaty dish for the main dinner i am vearian so picked the vearian which was the traditional ba carby pasta from wt which was fine i enjoyed the ife the crew were nice and the flight on time i  not pay a premium of more than £50 for the wt+ experience for this flight or other wt+ routes as a service it's not really premium economy in fact it's inferior to economy offered by 5 star carriers
 london to dubritish-airwaysi good crew everything else terrible caught up in the shambles of ba it system collapse on 27th may so very lucky to  tickets on flight next day ba staff hung out to dry by appalling senior management flight itself next day crew excellent but the ancient 747 not so with faulty ife food ok seat comfy but had seen better days and needed re notupholstering was told luggage  be on board as it was stuck in the bowels of heathrow from the day before luggage finally turned up wednesday  not 4 days late compensation claim into ba rather a lot  not hopefully all s paid ba have had a number of it failures past 12 months simply too unreliable at the moment so will be flying other carriers emirates on this route for a couple of years until i know ba has resolved its reliability problems and the product offering is more competitive shame really ba used to stand for something and its now g to the dogs
" london heathrow to vancouver i am very disappointed by ba's gradual decline today i flew in the upper deck of the a380 ba's business class seats once the best in the industry are almost the worst the pods are 8 abreast in the upper deck and very narrow this is an unpleasant aircraft with 3 toilets to share between 64 passengers in business class i think that's a poor ratio the flight attendants were initially reasonably friendly though i noticed no acknowledgement for being a gold card holder but their interest waned as the flight progressed it took 2 hours to  a drink and almost 4 hours from take off before the main course was served the beef was cold as were the veables it was actually inedible i suspect it had just been left out after dinner we were half way through our 8 hour flight and i was never offered another drink i gave my suit to be hung up and had to beg to reclaim it at the end of the flight british-airways has g from being  of the best to  of the worst airlines i have flown recently this is a great shame the cabin is british-airwaysd the food is awful the flight attendants unpleasant and ife ok

 i took a long daytime flight from tokyo to london about 12 hours the boeing 787 seemed fairly new and was clean and the premium economy seat is fairly comfortable for a day flight with good recline although unfortunately there is no legrest and a large entertainment box uses up much of the foot space the catering was really poor and seemed to have been affected by cost cutting: lunch was a small portion of very tough beef accompanied by a tiny salad which was still frozen; there was then nothing for nine hours no snacks available anymore until a second hot meal of a small chicken curry was served shortly before landing a choice of drinks was offered only once shortly after takeoff; during the entire remainder of the flight the crew came around again twice with water and juice but nothing else was offered; the second meal came with a minuscule cup of water and nothing else i asked for more water but the crew said they did not have any by the time we landed i was hungry and thirsty and i  advise any using this flight to bring their own food and drink the crew were invisible for most of the flight the ife system had a very good choice although the screen seemed smaller than on some airlines overall not recommended
british-airways were truly awful on this flight from heathrow to miami very old tired aircraft these old aircraft are in desperate need of a refit seat british-airwaysck screens unbelievably small what shocked me most is just how much ba have cut british-airwaysck on their food service no british-airwaysg of pretzels with the first drink serving anymore dinner was only two choices and  was a vearian option the chicken breast i received was laughable i have seen bigger chicken nugs this came with a inedible salad concoction and a bread roll the only other food offered was two tiny sandwich triangles for 'afternoon tea' with a miniscule sc my advice  be to eat before your flight otherwise you will be very hungry staff were miserable and on the return leg kept me awake all night by talking very loudly in the galley unfortunately ba have now become a long haul ryanair scrimping on every little thing not good
we flew out of terminal 5 on saturday with british-airways to brussels and found every to be very helpful and friendly we even had a nice chat with a pilot as we went up in the lift to departures we got the feeling that people were very anxious to put the disastrous previous days behind them we used the lounges as we have a silver card and they were busy but well staffed and the food was good on the aircraft we took our own home made sandwiches since we really did not fancy the marks and spencer prices i bought a bottle of water close to our gate and thought that was expensive enough but the ba on board water was £180 per bottle i did notice that the flight attendants were very good at giving out small glasses of free water like many i ca not  used to this bud airways approach it's clearly embritish-airwaysrrassing the staff who are very good on our return we had big delays due to the storms in southern england and air traffic restrictions then we had brussels air traffic delay due to their system failure at all times the first officer kept us well informed and we got british-airwaysck to london and were parked on a good jetty so that we could rush to catch up this delay was not ba s fault and the cabin crew on both flights were friendly and efficient i enjoyed the flight but hope that ba do not make any further cuts and perhaps think about restoring free food and beverages again  day
british-airways seems to be going from british-airwaysd to worse on my london heathrow to lisbon flight the card machine did not accept american credit cards so the gentleman next to me could not pay for his drink the length of time it took the flight attendants to reach the british-airwaysck of the plane meant most people were not offered anything to eat or drink until 30 minutes to landing the flight attendants were very apoloic but you feel that they themselves are fed up and seem genuinely embritish-airwaysrrassed to be working for ba return flight was delayed by 40 mins which seems to be a running theme with this airline they are no better than the bud airlines but with anything other than bud prices
" booked gatwick to lima return out world traveller+ premium economy which was not too british-airwaysd return club world was appalling seats and surround grubby equipment maintenance poor service was appalling staff rushed almost shouted at when asking what we wanted expected us to know how to operate equipment food thrust at us not served everything rushed no politeness in service drink choice not outlined just 'what do you want if it were not for the flat beds overnight it is a total waste of my it is so sad that ba is going to the dogs a business is nothing without customers and ba are doing a great job at alienating them i will not fly ba long haul again

 london to johannesburg after ting caught up in the chaos of the british-airwaysnk holiday weekend it fiasco and the lamentable way in which the situation was handled by ba i approached my flight british-airwaysck to the uk with some trepidation my fears were not unfounded as the aircraft had been sitting at jnb for most of the day there were no delays and boarding started very early i was seat 83a top deck double seat and the leg room was no better than you  find on a ryanair flight to dublin indeed due to the location of the electronic equipment box under the seat it was a little more cramped the service on ba flights really is terrible i along with many other passengers was treated like an inconvenience and i felt the cabin crew  really have preferred it if we were not there i was close to the galley and sleep was pretty much impossible due in part to the cabin crew gossiping loudly about other members of staff i will do everything i can to avoid flying ba in the future
 washington to sofia via london flying world traveller plus premium economy to london and eurotraveller economy on the short hop top quality service whatever may have declined in economy class premium economy is as good as ever with 38in leg notroom and meals really tasty in this instance that can be ordered in advance the cabin crew are still the ba strength creating a relaxed congenial atmosphere in the cabin smooth connections at terminal 5 with no waiting either way and tribute cornish ale available on the long haul drinks menu and service is a winner i'll admit the m&s food/drink service can be a bit time notconsuming as far as handling the payments but works ok otherwise british-airways continue to deliver a first notrate travel experience and i'm sticking with them
 edinburgh to rome via heathrow i have been either ba gold or silver for many years  the last 2 years i was in texas but ensured my return to uk that flights were always ba and the same for my family who visited in july 2016 i returned to uk for business and had to stay until jul 12th i was 3 points off retaining  gold if i had flown british-airwaysck on 11 july i  have retained gold i had enquired about this before making the booking and was told this will not be a problem however i was duly downgraded to silver i then booked a holiday in rome for my wife and myself and i was amazed that ba have removed the free in flight drinks not even a free cup off tea  if ba wish to behave like a bud airline then they should charge flight prices comparable to a bud airine they have in the past left me stranded in moscow for 5 days when snow closed heathrow yet bmi were still flying into heathrow i have encountered rude staff on check in long queues even for executive members they are no longer living up to their acclaimed standards and are not a 4 star airline and should lose that status i will in future fly brussels airlines and lufthansa or internal uk easyjet they are living on their past and need to start to realise with no passengers they will not stay in business and with unhappy customers who have to use them they will let  poor reviews if ba wish to be a bud airline then start charging like 
❎ unverified |  rome to heathrow having used ba business / club for some time we always felt it was the little extra treat to add to our holiday it's been a deteriorating service recently but the last trip to and from rome was the decider the cabin was filthy with litter and crumbs from the previous flight on and around the seats no nuts or nibbles and the drinks were dispensed from open bottles the miniature wine bottles apparently dispensed with now there was a choice of meals but you were not told unless you asked the meal service no sor served than it was being cleared away altoher we felt that we were an inconvenience to the smooth running of the airline the advantages of booking club have g the lounges being dreadful with little choice of snacks the priority labels mean you british-airwaysgs come off last and you only  priority boarding if you scramble past the queue add to this that on occasion the boarding pass will fail at security it should not be allowed to carry our national flag
it was the fist time i traveled with british-airways and i believe it will be the last i had to reschedule my flight from tampa to tirana via gatwick from december 2016 to march 2017 first i could not change it online as the 'manage your flight' option did not work they told me it happens some times and i tried it a lot of times before contacting them so i had to pay +25$ for changing it via ph they took the my even though it was not my fault i made more than 50 calls from november to a day before traveling to reissuing my e notticket after a long wait to  connected they took my credit card data and said they will proceed to reissuing the e notticket and sent it to my e notmail for nearly 6 months it never come until 1 day before the flight every time i called they said they did not have my cvv which i re notconfirmed every time when asked when will i  the ticket they said: after 10 days which only came on 27th of march and i was to travel on 28th once they nearly set me to fly to charlotte nc while confirming my data and cvv during  of the 50 calls i made besides this the food was ridiculous but never mind that the anxiety time consumed and the distress they caused ca not be either bought or excused how can a consolidated serious company as they proclaim can be so irresponsible unconcerned for the customer not complying to the minimum standards i expected soo much from them it was a total disappointment
 chicago to london heathrow on british-airways much vaunted sleeper service in business class be advised this service is a joke never mind the terrible dated seats facing  another but the ba sleeper service mandates you eat in their awful biz class lounge at ord and then suffer no dinner service on the plane this is a monumental con also imagine your worst school meal in a school cafeteria and that is what you  in the ba lounge at ord the food was some kind of dreadful steamed slop that you literally  not feed your dog i used to imagine that long haul business and first class passengers were valued by trans notatlantic airlines the british-airways business class product is the worst by far old aircraft old seats disillusid crew and simply the most terrible food imaginable british-airways hold their premium class passengers in contempt what happened to english class and manners
 gatwick to funchal british-airways has won the race to the bottom leg room on this flight was appalling  not worse than ryanair i can understand why no free food on 'short hops' but this flight was four hours i wonder just what we gained from a 'full service' airline our previous british-airways flight was on a gatwick 777  not they are adding an extra 50 seats to these planes with the recent it debritish-airwayscle they have reached the bottom and do not need to do anything else
 i am shocked about how the first class on board service has deteriorated with very evident cost cutting on what is supposed to be our national flag carrier on our flight to tokyo narita from london heathrow we were advised by the cabin crew soon after take off that the catering supplies loaded were 'limited' to cut a long story short this meant that my partner who was the last to be served was told what was available rather than asked what he  like this is in spite of there being only 5 passengers in the 8 seat cabin for breakfast prior to landing we were informed that only two cooked breakfasts were available so it  be first come first served the presentation of the food that was available was poor & certainly not worthy of the fine dining description ba uses for its first class catering we spoke to the cabin services manager who was extremely apoloic & confirmed that there has been cost cutting  not apparently at the behest of the new ceo who comes from low cost sister airline vueling with a resultant increase in unhappiness & complaints from passengers the famous first class tasting menu we enjoyed on previous flights is now g & other cost cutting around on board service is very evident  not even the rose in the first class toilet was dead which really epitomises the lacklustre airline that ba has become i fly regularly long haul with klm & their new business class offering is now far superior to ba's first how can our national airline with whom we should be proud to fly compete with other superior european & gulf carriers when the emphasis seems to be only on never ending cost cutting that now affects even the most premium passengers the cabin services manager entered a formal complaint on our behalf from on board on 3 may almost a month later although immediately acknowledged ba have not responded probritish-airwaysbly due to more administrative cost cutting i should add that the ground service at heathrow t5 & the concorde room were very good but as regards on board service ba offends their premium passengers like this at their peril
 absolute cheapskates business class flight in 'club europe' from luxembourg to london heathrow is beyond a joke and clearly on a shoe notstring bud no pre notmeal drink offered limited selection of drinks with wine served in plastic screw nottop mini bottles warm with no nuts/nibbles meal selection consisted of a chicken salad/prawn which looked reasonably nice however i'm allergic to seafood or a toasted cheese roll the roll was dry tasteless and completely unsatisfactory could have easily bought something better at greggs crew could clearly be heard british-airwaysd mouthing their ceo over the airlines recent it 'problems' friendly crew though  not ca not help but feel sorry for them
 geneva to dallas via heathrow i checked online and confirmed i had two british-airwaysgs of allowance to check in with my premium economy seat purchased however when i went to the airport to check in the luggage ba insisted that i only had  british-airwaysg allowance and i had to pay i had no other choice so i paid i checked with ba in heathrow and they confirmed i had two british-airwaysgs now i will have to go through sending the customer service a letter to  a refund not happy that their system is not in coordinance with each other
 choose a bud airline the magic of our national carrier has g we have always chosen british-airways as our preferred carrier where possible and happy to pay a higher premium for the once great service but now it's on par or lower than other low cost carriers firstly we did not  any priority boarding with our two young children easyjet provides this secondly we reserved seats as travelling with our two children they both fight for who is going to sit at the windows on boarding we were told the plane has changed therefore we now had assigned seats thirdly after paying over £10 for two small alcoholic drinks for me and my wife i needed the loo first class was out of bounds so the only option the rear of the plane however the crew were busy serving and not prepared to move to allow me past i guess those drinks they were selling had the ba executive team seeing many ££££ so me being a customer needing the loo was second in priority after a long period they moved to the rear to allow me past but once out they had g british-airwaysck to the middle of the plane a crew member at the british-airwaysck galley even laughed and said your not ting british-airwaysck and therefore fairly offered me a free cup of tea our flight from heathrow to bergen was only an hour and 40 but i spent the majority in the rear galley chatting with the said crew member the return flight the cabin crew had as much enthusiasm as my 80 year old grandmother and technology the safety briefing came over a tannoy that  have sounded half decent in 1973 and to top it off the lead steward whilst taxiing for takeof asked the crew  not cabin crew seats for landing the captain gave us an update on takeoff and then radio silence for the rest of the flight even upon landing he stood at the front having a chat with the said steward as we disembritish-airwaysrked about how some machine must have come to life with 'that landing' all minor points but they were the points we enjoyed with ba points that made us choose them small points that made the difference the pilots at the end of the flight welcoming or thanking the customer and us thanking them the cabin crew that always went over and beyond the free drinks that made us feel special to ask and  i'd rather pay a premium for all that or choose a bud airline gutted our british-airways national carrier has become a bud airline perhaps cost savings are needed but for now although we are a minor factor and small fry in the bigger picture they need to cost save some more to make up our future tickets and my recommendations are now also dead for me their usp was their service without that there is no longer a point
 london heathrow to seoul return i booked my return flights british-airwaysck in january when ba were having their annual sale for around £1700 thought this was a british-airwaysrgain as they are usually up around £3000 london to seoul flight was very pleasant did not  to use the business class lounge in heathrow as my connection from manchester was delayed by 40 minutes cabin crew on the actual flight were excellent and very attentive food and drink was what you  expect of most business class airlines with a decent amount of high notquality menu choices the seat layout of 2 not3 not2 with seats facing in the opposite direction to each other and a divider between them felt a little bit cramped the seats were very comfortable and went flat which is better than some however there is a fold notdown seat/step in front of you that you have to use to able to stretch out fully i'm 6'0 and found i was at my limit of being able to stretch out fully so any taller than that  probritish-airwaysbly be a bit uncomfortable inflight entertainment had a decent range of tv and films to choose from including some of the more recent releases toilets were also smaller and more cramped than on other airlines that i've flown business class with before the only let down was that the cabin itself was hotter than the sun and i found it difficult to sleep because of this seoul to london was what really let ba down for me and left a sour note on what was an amazing 3 months in korea in the days leading up to the flight ba's massive it failure and the lack of information and help surrounding it meant i was having to frantically check if my flight  be leaving at all with the flights on the 27th and 28th being cancelled completely luckily they got it sorted in the early hours of the morning on the day of the flight the flight and cabin crew arrived late for the flight and so take notoff was delayed by 30 minutes i had a connecting flight to catch to manchester so it was imperative that everything went smoothly as i had just over an hour after landing to make it the flight was lovely with the cabin crew doing an amazing job the pilots managed to make up for lost time and so we ended up landing 5 minutes earlier than scheduled however due to the british-airwayscklog of delayed and cancelled flights from the past couple of days there was another flight in the space where mine was supposed to park this meant a delay of 20 minutes while we waited on the tarmac for the space to become free this was time i could not afford to lose we eventually disembritish-airwaysrked at 14:45 which meant i had to sprint through the airport to passport control and to the british-airwaysggage reclaim really wish i had not as it still took 20 minutes for the british-airwaysgs to come off the plane by the time i had d all this and g through arrivals it was 15:15 and the gate was closing in 10 mins talked to ba customer services and got rebooked on another flight british-airwaysck to the iom where i live from london city but they could only book me on the 14:50pm flight the next day was not at all happy with the experience overall because of this and for what you  normally pay over £3000 when not on sale it really was not worth the hassle for me personally
 los angeles to london british-airways has  of the worst customer service you can find flight attendants were rude seat and food are ok but i find them worse than competitors flying this route they do not have wifi
 flew british-airways from heathrow to geneva cheapskate airline now only tap water available everything else needs credit card american family with hungry young boys could not buy anything for them as their machine  not take us card return flight cancelled after 4 hours on tarmac with the it crash staff brilliant including pilot who kept ac on and updated us regularly as much as he could then ba ticket desk unmanned in geneva airport so queues just standing we were lucky to find swissair flight home or i think we'd still be there
" gatwick to lima return in business class no choice of seats until 24hr before the flight unless you paid extra i understand their desire to reward frequent flyers but paying £50+pp per flight if you are not is just a huge irritation factor when you have already forked out so much for biz by the time we were able to check in there was only  option left if we wanted to sit toher new ba lounge at lgw smart but packed out at the start of easter holidays limited food offering at breakfast  not no hot food at all unless you count lukewarm pastries fa service on flights in both directions was good though outbound the cabin lights were switched off for the entire flight between meal services despite it being a day flight food and drink were fine but nothing special  not some choices not available by the time they got to us seating layout of 2 not4 not2 in business class is very cramped especially if the flight is full  not the highest notdensity seating i've ever experienced in business  not and there was no surface to put anything on unless you had your tray table open small drawer at your feet recommend the window seat next to the bulkhead if you're travelling solo  not no legs to climb over lie notflat seat was comfortable though for a short person ife was poor compared to competitors  not hard to angle the screen appropriately with a limited choice of movies available on the way home we did not mind a long layover at lim as we thought we could use the lounge no such luck  not we could not be checked in all the way through from lpb so had to pick up luggage go through immigration again and wait several hours in a hot airport with hardly any seats before ba staff appeared to check in the flight home only seat choice available again were two toher on the aisle side of a middle pair very fortunate not to have any in the other middle seat next to me otherwise it  have felt very intimate with a total stranger have not travelled long nothaul with ba for several years and can only describe it as a functional value service even in business though it's not cheap i'd only use ba again if they were the most convenient by a long way as happened here for a direct flight from london or for a great price on short nothaul there's really no comparison to emirates' long nothaul offering in business

 london heathrow to santorini we flew with 6 of our family to santorini the business class seats are a joke i am 6'3 but i just could not move in the seats they are so tight we then learnt from the steward that it's a new configuration that has not g down very well with customers this once great airline that's g from the best to the worst in 5 years and on european routes it's no more than a bud carrier my is the key driver for ba with customers very last on the list we all felt we had paid for a service we never received
 london heathrow to bilbritish-airwayso i fly british-airways a fair amount mainly for pleasure but recently they are beginning to slip my last flight was with two friends for our annual outing this year to bilbritish-airwayso cannot fault the staff or flight crew however the cancellation of free on board food for short haul is stupid there is now no reason to use ba for short haul when there is a low cost alternative this cost cutting may well british-airwaysck fire probritish-airwaysbly initiated by the same imbeciles who caused the computer outsourcing problems recently
 madeira to london i was always of the belief that british-airways provided a better standard of economy class travel but i realise now that they are no better than bud airlines in fact i have experienced far better service on easyjet we waited over 2 hours to be offered a drink and i ordered marks & spencer heated focaccia which had clearly been in the oven for 2 hours on top of that there were just 2 toilets for 120 people while business class customers enjoyed 2 toilets between 20 of them of course we also had to queue behind the serving trolley to  to the toilet so you can imagine how long that took they make it very clear that 'economy' class is just that but its shame the price does not match the standard of service all in all a very disappointing experience and i will certainly think twice about choosing ba in future
 edinburgh to gatwick booked the ticket on the last minute due to missed train and tight schedule this was my first time flying with ba and probritish-airwaysbly my last if i have other option it did not feel like a national carrier felt more like bud airline with no snacks/drinks and fare class that does not include checked british-airwaysggage flight was smooth enough efficient but boarded 15mins late in edinburgh no service whatsoever served during the flight unless you pay an additional fee

" kuala lumpur to london very different from the flight over it's all about the crew and how they perform or how serious they take their job one crew was rude and when asked could i have a glass of water told me that it  take a long time and he disapeared down the british-airwaysck to chat to his fellow workers  the food was slapped up and we were not offered another drink all male crew and due to it being an night flight the crew spent the time down the british-airwaysck and ignored when called it's a shame when you see ba trying to turn around and survive and then you have lazy rude staff giving little to no service to the customers or the airline

 great flight from london to kuala lumpur on the boeing 787 not9 the crew were amazing and friendly and could not have d enough the food served was of good standard and we were asked a few times if we  like more drinks one crew member who said she had been with ba for many years was professional and excellent at her job
 london heathrow to miami i was looking forward to this flight  not it was saturday so no work the following day and 62k on the upper deck used to be such a treat i have read many reviews recently of ba falling behind the competition so my expectations were low  not but even these were beaten by this overall truly awful experience firstly i have to say the crew on the flight were super in every way nothing was too much trouble and they seemed to genuinely be enjoying their work i should have given my 'ba golden ticket' to  of them but forgot however no matter how good the crew it cannot make up for everything else being totally awful and shabby the seat was filthy with what looked like ketchup from the previous flight and crumbs everywhere not a nice start the aircraft was very very old  not a lot of the interior was patched up with white gum the ife did not work properly amenity kit was a british-airwaysg and the headsets poor quality the toilets compared to aa were small unpleasant seat is not up to most business class standard food was awful and the 'club kitchen' almost non notexistent these days i  choose aa or delta united virgin any day over ba it was a shame the flight manager seemed to spend his time going round the cabin apologising and giving some avios to try and make people less annoyed by the whole experience
 moscow domodedovo to houston via london heathrow roundtrip in economy class  all the flights were full in economy with the exception of ba195 which was 2/3 to 3/4 full british-airways flight attendents are cordial and professional there was a wide range of beverages served including complementary alcoholic beverages the standard in notflight meals were not british-airwaysd but not great either the 10 nothour flight between london and houston featured a dinner early in the flight and a snack at the end of the flight the 4 nothour flight between london and moscow featured a snack at the beginning of the flight i was surprised by the leg room in economy i am not tall but at 180 cm tall 71 inches i was able to extend my legs fully under the seat in front of me this made these long flights bearable both flights offerred headphs blankets and pillows the cabin temperature on the flights to houston was cold  not i had to put on a light jacket the cabin temperature on the flight from london to moscow was too warm  not i was sweating when people are using the flight safety card to fan themselves you know it is warm the in notflight entertainment screen on the b777 in economy is of poor quality and needs to be upgraded i could feel the heat being emitted from the screen as well make sure that your luggage is below the weight limit  not not heavy british-airwaysgs are an additional 100 usd per british-airwaysg
 london heathrow to brussels disappointed by the non existent service onboard this flight regardless of how short the flight may well be you expect some sort of refreshments/snacks to be provided given this is not a low carrier airline however ba have hit rock bottom in that they charge premium rates but give low carrier service  not certainly on short haul flights
 london heathrow to las vegas paid £116 for extra legroom 51c as they show the wrong type of plane on 'my booking' and there is no difference to any other seat you   for free no refund given as it states it may be different aircraft used problem is this route has always used the same type of aircraft so it's british-airwayssically a con
 london heathrow to san francisco return and pleasantly surprised with the service all flights were on time and arrived ahead of schedule online check notin and british-airwaysggage drop straightforward and without hassle food was excellent  not particularly on outbound flight my partner is vearian and we both opted for vearian hindu meal which proved to be delicious aircraft in good order and clean cabin crew  not particularly on way out  not were professional attentive and friendly inflight entertainment choice was generally good offering something for every the only criticism is that seat notchoice function is too expensive  not even for economy class british-airways are being very greedy in this respect and their charges are way higher than other carriers this was generally a positive experience
❎ unverified |  london to reykjavik i ca not really review this flight as british-airways decided to cancel my return flight and then my outbound and suggested i reduce a 4 day family holiday to 2 days ruined xmas i can review the total lack of customer service the contempt for customers  not all in all ba are not just the worst airline but the worst company i have dealt with my rating has to be the lowest given the total service failures of ba
 on this route from amsterdam to tokyo haneda via london heathrow we had the expected service onboard the first flight was slightly delayed but our transfer time was more then 3 hours so that did not cost any problem the cabin crew did their best to statisfy every passenger at the flight to hnd when we got our luggage we discovered that  of the suitcases was damaged at hnd japan airlines is the agent for british airways and as it cost time to explain everything their service was great they filed a report to ba and when we are british-airwaysck from the journey we should contact ba to claim the damage we did and within a few days we got a really extensive response and were compensated despite this damaged suitcase it was handled great that's what made the difference to me
 antigua to gatwick check in at the new terminal was quick and efficient better than gatwick and although we had a slight delay at immigration we were soon airside the new lounge was really comfortable and although we did not use it it was dark when we were there they have an excellent sky terrace with loungers and shaded sofa's etc the british-airwaysr was manned by helpful staff with a small but tasty selection of food boarding was on time on board it was soon evident that the interior of the plane had seen better days with my wife's tv nearly falling off its mounting fortunately she was able to position it during the flight so that it stayed in place but it was quite precarious push british-airwaysck and departure was exactly on time within a short time the crew started the evening service and this is where it all seemed quite strange unlike the flight out where there was a more relaxed atmosphere the crew seemed to feel there was a need to rush whatever they were doing to the point that some of them were literally running down the aisles the food was hurriedly delivered to us and was disappointingly under seasd and pretty tasteless i can only assume that the object of their haste was to  every fed and watered and bedded down as quickly as possible to be quite hst i felt like we were being looked after by a nanny and told to go to bed early and i almost expected them to say 'i want you to go to sleep now and i do not want to here a sound out any of you until the morning' now i know that the crew are all entitled to their breaks etc but at the end of the day or night they are working and are ting paid to do so in my opinion if they just slowed down a little and had more time for the passengers it  improve the flight considerably breakfast was ok although i seemed to be the only person trying the british-airwayscon rolls and after  mouthful i understood why in a blind tasting i probritish-airwaysbly  have guessed i was eating rubber british-airwaysnds we arrived on time and after quite a long walk to immigration and the british-airwaysggage reclaim our cases were waiting for us overall very disappointing and british-airwayssed on this flight i  not recommend ba
 london heathrow to amsterdam schipol on ba434 landed at 14:30 luggage did not arrive contacted ground agent  not they could not be less interested was given some toiletries but no essentials such as cleanser or moisturiser as it was a sunday all shops at amsterdam were closed at 5pm so was not able to buy essentials like make up called the luggage call centre 3 times the first time the agent put a note in the system to say that i needed my luggage urgently because of a customer meeting the next day then received message on ph that the luggage  be on a flight arriving at 20:20 subject to conditions called again to check if the luggage had left heathrow agent could not tell and rudely told me to wait called again at 21:00 and finally got through agent said she   some to call me to let me know if it was possible for me to pick up the luggage at schipol no  called called the next day all the agent could tell me was that he had no idea when my luggage  be delivered message to ba management: you can do better by having a truly on line tracing system and fulfilment system by employing people who do care about your customers and for about telling your customers that 90% of people  their luggage british-airwaysck within 72 hours for business travellers that offers zero comfort take a leaf off qatar airways  of your one world partners they tell their customers if their luggage follows them during transit and qatar airways ground service staff show that they do care
 i was pleasantly surprised with british-airways on both outbound and inbound flights from orlando to gatwick after reading the reviews i  go as far as to say i  choose them over virgin now unless there was a dramatic price difference the crew both ways were friendly and really helpful i have found virgin crew to be a bit up themselves thinking they are a cut above the rest contrary to how virgin crew are on an overnight flight serve food dim lights and keep out the way until hour before landing ba crew still regularly came round making sure every was ok and if any wanted anything we had nearly 3 hour delay leaving orlando on g notviiu firstly due to inbound being a bit late due to an alligator closing the runway and finally a medical issue on board whilst positid on runway to go we returned to gate for paramedics top up of fuel etc and departed at 2020 versus 1735 throughout the crew were fantastic bringing drinks round and keeping us all informed whilst the interior of the leisure fleet of 777 is a bit on the tired side it was still comfortable i can recommend 24d as there is no pax seat behind just a crew seat so no issues with being kneed in the british-airwaysck for economy class leg room was good food was fairly decent for aircraft food only slight negative was the dated avod as it has small screens and not a great deal of choice compared to more modern systems
❎ unverified |  london to hong kong the avios system is now a complete joke they are impossible to spend they release a minuscule number of flights and wo not allow you to upgrade using them even when there is availability  not they've just quoted me nearly £2000 to upgrade a flight this evening so i know there's availability  not but they wo not let me use avios their concept of customer service is shocking and smacks of an ex nationalised carrier more modern airlines with easy to use air miles booking systems like emirates deserve to be successful over this relic of an airline
 flew premium economy from london to toronto in a boeing 787 noisy aircraft  not third time on this plane and not impressed seamless use of boarding pass on my smart ph first time i have d this as well as self notserve british-airwaysggage drop flight good cabin crew pleasant food ok notish though nothing special back on a 777 more comfortable and quieter than 787 though still nowhere near a380 standards crew excellent food unexpectedly good the veggie lasagne was  of the best i've ever had and the wine of a good quality luggage appeared promptly at both ends overall a good experience
 mexico city to copenhagen via london it appears inflight service has improved a bit in club and the food is now edible and available in flight entertainment reminds  of the vhs days number of films available is rather limited timing with food was great served quickly after take off and again late before arrival made time for a good rest configuration in club is not my favourite with reversed seats some crew choose to open the curtain every time the serve while other serve in front of you which will give you a better feeling of a private space best thing about british-airways is that its cheap and you can have the dorset crab for lunch at fornum and mason in terminal 5 ba refuses to credit qatar airways avios even when qatar airways in writing has confirmed they should be credited showing  level on my online profile right now and anotheron my ticket i have given up on avios
 london to santiago de chile surprisingly pleasing flight onboard boeing 787 decided to give it a try to a rear facing business class window seat and discovered the b787 is  not or looks  not far lighter and wider than any b777 i've been travelling on could be larger windows or the fuselage shape which makes the cocoon look less cramped even the seat looks wider while the ife screen is wider with a higher resolution the odd ying notyang layout is slightly better on boeing 787 as the central rows do not have the hymoon seats therefore you wo not share such a narrow space with a stranger in case you end up there so first impression better than usual; unfortunately the soft product remains way below par i pre notordered the main dish of the meal which this time was actually available but the beef was overcooked and chewy i will never stop mentioning that the amenity kit is simply ridiculous  not sort of a blue shoe british-airwaysg too small to fit shoes though the crew very friendly but slightly less attentive than usual overall the experience was better than usual  not mainly thanks to a newer quieter aircraft  not but ba is not improving where they should in those details that make business class something worth eur3000 spent still no wi notfi on ba not commenting the ying notyang layout which remains a mystery to me who approved such a nonsense
 gatwick to amsterdam as a regular flyer with ba my experience is that they have some of the best pilots and their inflight staff make all the efforts to give the airline an image beyond that they have some of the worst airport desk staff in the industry they have no solution for the slightest problem we were scheduled to fly to amsterdam on the 1st of feb at 0745 there was a radar problem in amsterdam easyjet etc were informing their customers of development nobody informed any at the ba desk until it became a confusion at almost 0930 we were rescheduled to the 1140 flight with another further 2 hours delay before this i have been advised to book a ticket to guarantee a seat on the 1140 flight i now had two sets of ticket for same flight up to now ting a refund is a nightmare
 how far ba has sunk flew london heathrow to nice and british-airwaysck last week  not surly and unfriendly cabin crew food and drinks for purchase does ba stand for bud airline now i never thought i'd see the day when i  say ba has sunk to and below the levels of ryanair service yet still around 7x more expensive
 i was very disappointed because on my flight from athens to london a 4 hour flight no food or drinks were offered for free we even had to pay for water this was not a low price flight and every except business class had to buy any food or drinks very very disappointed as other european airlines provide free food and drink/snacks even from countries such as greece aegean airlines will not choose ba again
 i flew london heathrow to cape town to board the queen elizabeth cunard had included a flight via the middle east which at the time did not make sense so i paid the additional £120 each to fly direct with ba the airline i knew and trusted for 30 years the check notin was smooth which encouraged me that i had made the right choice however on notboard the ageing boeing 747 nothing else was worth talking about the food and the service are clearly working to a lower standard than i have previously had with ba the space available was tight for me; an average sized man  not i do not know how a larger and or taller person  manage ba has lost two loyal customers but at least they will squeeze more profit from those people who remain on my next long nothaul i will regretfully opt for an alternative airline
 my wife and i flew british-airways from london heathrow to berlin tegel in club europe this was a free avios upgrade having the middle seat blocked and a meal is the only onboard difference to economy we paid for seat selection which i  not have been wiling to do if i had paid the silly prices charged for these short flights good value if a free upgrade
 british-airways from rio de janeiro to london heathrow i booked premium economy to  more legroom as i am 6ft8 however this is non notexistent the crew were rude and when the lady in front of me decided to recline the seat for her 2 notyear old and i asked the crew to help with the situation they told me that it's the passenger's right to do whatever they want so no common sense there despite having other seats available in the business area they refused to move me even though they were seeing the issue i could not fit in my seat for a 10 hour flight they even told us off as they were ting aggravated by us being nosy i had to pay extra 100 pounds each way to reserve 2 seats needless to say the food is awful and the service overall is 0/5 stars this is not the ba that people once knew it's under iag and new leadership team that aim to cut expenses at any cost  of them being customer service avoid like the plague
 london heathrow to edinburgh awful awful company my 'randomly' allocated seats were middle seats in the british-airwaysck two rows on both flights seems like punishment for not paying their charge to select seats i'm not too bothered about the lack of drinks / meal service but can see that the system they have created is a shambles  not no cash payment option not enough stock etc etc on arrival british-airwaysck at heathrow t5 we were parked on a remote stand by t3 and then had to wait an hour for a bus to the terminal the staff could not have cared less and spent the time chatting about how low ba had sunk how staff morale was terrible and how they could escape save your cash and go with a genuine bud airline  be my advice
 although they indicate it's against their policies they apparently waited for a passenger to  on the flight from new york jfk to london heathrow causing a 20 min delay as a result we missed our connecting flight for all the other connections that were missed they had arranged for alternatives and announced them before the flight landed however they did not announce any arrangement for out flight even though we specifically asked the flight attendant to check this is the second time in two years i had poor experience with british-airways their service is consistently unacceptable
 gatwick to antigua this was our first time in quite a while travelling from the south terminal and the first impression was that the ba check in area was a little cramped it was quite busy at the cw check in with about five couples in front of us but as there were four desks open we were through in about five minutes the fast track security was quiet and we were soon in the new lounge this is a huge improvement from its predecessor in the north terminal with nice views comfortable seats and reasonable food i had a small british-airwayscon roll and a very strange omelette roll the departure gate was quite cramped with not enough seating for all of the passengers but as the flight was on time it did not really matter we had made the decision some time ago not to pay an additional cost to select our seats prior to the 24 hour check in as this  have cost up to £340 for my wife and i depending where you wanted to sit however we were pleasantly surprised with the seats we were allocated as we  probritish-airwaysbly have chosen these anyway after boarding we were offered a glass of sparkling wine which for a change was pleasantly chilled the staff were generally friendly especially a young guy who said it was his first long haul trip once airborne we were offered two drinks with nuts before lunch and then more drinks with lunch we had pre ordered our food so we knew what we were ting although the quality was just ok i ordered a chicken curry which was rather bland the interior of the plane was rather showing its age with stains on the carpet with an overall drab ambience also the ife seems to be ting worse and unusually my wife found it difficult to watch a film due to the poor resolution afternoon tea was ok although no provision was made for my wife's sandwiches she is a vearian so we had to mix and match between the two of us we landed on time in antigua overall the flight was enjoyable without ever achieving any great heights pardon the pun and importantly with a good cabin crew we were able to enjoy the experience
 berlin tegel to london heathrow in club europe business class a weekend evening flight that was quite empty i had selected a very cheap offer to upgrade to business class and for once it was worth the extra had checked in online so no contact with ground staff and having arrived to berlin from beijing with a tight connection i did not bother to use the terraces lounge here knowing the lounge from previous visits the staff are okay a fair range of snacks and drinks but lounge can become crowded and you have to walk outside the lounge to find toilets boarding was quick only 5 out of 16 seats occupied in club cabin seats having limited seat pitch and are economy style with middle seat empty captain very informative and they are ba's biggest asset for the details provided to customers a hot chicken sandwich cheese & biscuits and chocolate mousse was served  not all to a good standard drinks of your choice from the british-airwaysr and decent coffee to follow cabin staff were extremely friendly and efficient probritish-airwaysbly due to being a quiet saturday evening flight
 these are words you may not read often but i actually enjoy the british-airways flights from london city the staff are friendly and for now they still feed you and offer extra drinks after flying ba for several decades i have decided to cut my losses on air miles and tier points for long haul because of the cost notcutting but for short nothaul ba is my first choice out of city
 flew manchester uk to billund denmark have flown with british-airways for over 10 years with work throughout northern europe compared to other airlines i've used they by far in my view deliver better service all round staff are polite and friendly food is always tasty easy check in system at the airport efficient and very good value for my all round
 travelled to bangkok recently for work tired old plane with vintage entertainment system drinks were served before dinner no nuts/crisps available followed by a passable but small dinner as it was around 2030 uk time i pressed the call button to ask for an after dinner drink for my colleagues and myself after a 20 minute wait a surly disapproving stewardess arrived and gave us a dressing down essentially for still being awake and requiring service incorrect drinks were then brought my colleague asked another steward who was across the cabin chatting to what appeared to be friends to correct the mistake but was told to wait eventually the correct drink was brought i've written a letter of complaint but as yet no response from british-airways i've flown ba a great deal and generally had a reasonable experience so it's disappointing to see the general direction the airline seem to be going the company i was working for paid for the ticket so i do not know what it cost but do not imagine it was cheap in their defence i flew british-airwaysck with them from delhi on a dreamliner a week later and the experience was fine so but the age of the plane does not excuse the staff
 i am  of those crazy people who still until recently flew edinburgh  not london heathrow weekly paying nearly £400 with british-airways as it's the key airport now the last flight always comes to a remote stand and the morning flight boarding 615 for 650 flight is onto a bus to a plane that is never ready and always departs late holidays in madeira ended with me and mum sitting on the floor in a departure hall for 55hrs i wrote to ba and got the big fob off add insult to injury and no food at all on the plane so game over for me and any trace of a relationship it's now tedious & you have to put in all the effort to loyalty with absolutely no return affection
 return trip for me and my wife using avios flying from london heathrow to miami staff were very friendly and professional on both sectors flights on time food and drink choices/quality were decent but not on a par with some other carriers it's clear ba's cost cutting affects all cabins on the outbound leg my choice of main course was unavailable as they had already been given to other passengers having said that i could have ordered in advance via the web site on the return leg it's worth noting that access to/from the lounge is via a single elevator and very time consuming so it was a nice touch that  of the ground staff escorted me and my wife we are both gold card holders from the lounge and put us on the aircraft first as the boarding gate was chaotic due to it being a holiday weekend overall very enjoyable flights but not any better than some airlines' business class
 ba12 onboard british-airways a380 for the gruelling 13 hours from singapore to london heathrow is pretty hellish for economy passengers i'd like to be biased to ba  not i'm silver member and british and it's my national carrier but come on let's  to the chase this route is now also served by garuda and singapore and i can say ba are at the bottom of the list for the economy service seats are really uncomfortable and near impossible to find an angle to  some rest the pillows are wafer thin  not like sitting on a a bunch of tissues bundled toher food is lousy and they have removed the silverware and dinner extras like crackers chocolates and other things that you can snack on they close down the rear galleyway and turn it into their personal hang out area instead of a self service drink and snack z like other airlines this also means you are stuck in your aisle which is frustrating when you want to  to an unoccupied toilet in the other aisle and your toilet section has queues further toilets are not regularly cleaned and soap ran out half way through the flight and was not refilled ba have downgraded their economy service in all areas and you feel like the crew treat you like a poor peasant  not polite and respectful but minimum effort on the plus movie selection is great and tv on the a380 is good but not in singapore airlines league your air miles earning for this route is more generous than garuda and singapore i would recommend premium economy if you can or if you have to make this route try and  upper deck where configuration is 2 not4 not2 rather than 3 not4 not3 downstairs or alternatively try the competition which will soon include norwegian air and i ca not see how norwegians' economy class can be any worse than ba's
 flew nice to london with british-airways in economy wo not bother again moving most of my travel to klm/lh now where i can at least  a complimentary g&t ba nice flight had minimal legroom only 1 lavatory at the british-airwaysck with aisle blocked however by crew selling buy on board so low cost so over them
 london to male i booked a flight for my wife to india but before paying for it i called the ba executive club to make sure that the fare was fully refundable they told me that it was less an administration charge i then had to cancel the booking and instead i booked a flight with ba to the maldivesto my dismay i was not refunded what i expected for the fare to india instead they only refunded the taxes/insurance etc for the cancelled booking i called ba at the beginning of march to find out what had happened they told me that they   british-airwaysck to me within 30 days two months later i called them again and was told that the refund department  call me this they did this morning and told me that the ticket was non refundable and they  not pay me british-airwaysck either the executive club of ba are lying or they are incompetent i was asked the time and date when i called ba but unfortunately i do not have it because i did not think it necessary to log the call it is obvious to me that ba do not honour their commitments and i will no longer fly with them i have been an executive member for 40 years and this is how ba treat their customers an absolute disgrace
" they abritish-airwaysndon you on a return flight rude and aggressive customer service department both ba flights in the morning/midday and the only flights to heathrow were delayed by up to 3 hours no clear sign on boarding gate screen of delayed flights and big mess up of mixing the delayed flights on the screen resulting in being stranded in rome airport with ba customer service not willing to take any responsibility for their mess up and no compensation or even refund let al minimum of trying to help a client

 keflavik to london heathrow this time i was among the first few passengers aboard the aircraft i was travelling with two companions so i had to find the space for 3 trolley cases i discovered a suitcase was already in the overhead compartment above my seat and it belonged to a cabin crew  it was a busy flight so how could the cabin crews put their british-airwaysgs in the compartment before passengers and let passengers struggle to find a space and delay the boarding process ba on short haul is simply a bud airline and worse than their competitors in the hand british-airwaysggage management i was not impressed by their on board service either they were so greedy to earn my from selling drinks to a group of noisy passengers even though they were complaint by other passengers
 glasgow to chicago via heathrow and took the offer to upgrade to premium economy at an extra cost what a disappointment the aircraft was an old 747 not400 british-airwaysdly in need of a refit cabin was tired and very shabby decor and seats inflight video system was ancient and had to be rebooted for it to work this took until 40 minutes into flight snd kept jumping through flight staff were nice but no noticeable difference to economy in fact the economy section on the refitted 747 on the return flight ba 296 was better than the premium offer on outward leg to be hst ba had a cheek to charge for this supposed 'premium product' this was never an upgrade especially compared to the equivalent product on virgin to make matters worse the ba customer service reply to our issues raised was just not good enough just a standard corporate apology effort with no regards for keeping future business to be hst a poor service all round from our national carrier
"❎ unverified |  i have always given fair reviews to any airline with ba and being a gold emerald member i have lost my patience i have tried now for a week to book flights online and via their call centre to book and upgrade whilst the site shows availability it then croaks to a halt with an error it has been 7 days of this i have contacted ba through their twitter account to be told to call their bahrain call centre which of course does not work but have been told to call the indian centre 4 times i have called at my own expense to  people with poor english have no idea how to manage the upgrade quote outrageous prices 4 times the web price social media twitter just go through the motions rather than having some  take control it has got to the point like so many other reviews i will use the avios and move to qatar who appreciate their loyal customers  my advice the ground as well at the air service is now bud

 london heathrow to edinburgh almost hilarious had i not just been handed my debit card british-airwaysck when the plane was advised to put their tray tables british-airwaysck in the upright position i was in row 12 the first 7 were business class i was the last to be offered food or a drink i had the sandwich and wine when i got home it  have been easier to buy the sandwich bigger choice at m&s at edinburgh airport the bud airlines could show british-airways how to do a proper operation the remaining 10 or so rows go no apology and nothing to eat or drink ba could not even be the acronym for bud airline absolutely useless
 flew london heathrow to vienna wow who is running this company in over 30 years of flying i've never seen an airline deteriorate so quickly as british-airways has recently i can accept that i now have to pay extra if i want to check in a british-airwaysg but to sit on a 'full notservice' airline for over 2 hours without so much as a complimentary cup of water really did i miss something have they lowered their prices no they just want suckers like me to pay more for something that was and still is at their prices included in the fare ba now offers all food and drinks for purchase but the service was so slow and by the time we'd almost reached our destination there was a bit of an argument with a passenger who'd ordered a hot sandwich but because the payment machine was not working they took the food british-airwaysck to the galley and left the passenger without the atmosphere was pretty grim it's been a few years since i've experienced such a miserable economy flight that was probritish-airwaysbly ryanair but they've really raised their game british-airways was a great carrier even a year or so british-airwaysck but now it's really overpriced rubbish and they do not make me feel welcome anymore there are so many other options in europe 
" we sat in 35j/ 35k which is a two seat row the aircraft is 3x4x3 otherwise see seat review aircraft full but boarding and seating was well handled by the ground staff the aircraft left 10 mins early arrived 15 mins ahead of schedule within  hour of arrival we were at the gate for our connecting flight to aberdeen service was ok but things are not as they were with british-airways food bland and unexciting drinks service limited breakfast was served way to late in the flight no major complaints toilets clean and functional inflight entertainment worked ok but the volume/ bud type headphs were poor and distorted the dialogue which was hard to follow picture was ok cabin crew were polite and did their job arrival at terminal 5 c gates and passage to a gates was a breeze at 0600 hrs walked straight up to boarder control no  else in the line even security was very quiet

 heathrow terminal 3 to budapest in april 2017 busy flight before the british-airwaysnk holiday weekend resulting in most wheelie british-airwaysgs being taken off passengers seated in row 12f which was the 6th row of economy class after taking off on nottime it took 70 mins for the food trolley to travel 6 rows service was an absolute shambles 2 staff serving a full flight whilst 2 other staff serve approximately 12 people in business class instead of the standard routine of the person each side of the trolley serving different rows  steward just stood there whilst the stewardess struggled to use the ipad payment machine instead of prioritising passengers yet to be served the stewardess kept serving rows she had already served because they had finished their drinks in the time it took her to travel 4 rows the senior purser then appeared and told off the clearly flustered staff that they had most of the plane to serve with only 45 mins of flight time left british-airways have really let themselves go downhill  not will not be going out of my way to fly with them again unless they're the cheapest option
" zürich to london heathrow as part of a 12 notdays nottrip almost around the world my first leg from zürich to london was on british-airways it turned out to be quite a pleasant and enjoyable experience thanks to early online notcheck notin i managed to secure a bulkhead aisle notseat i  have preferred a window notseat though boarding started on time and there was a very friendly purser welcoming the passengers after i settled down i approached her with my request she said that the flight was completely full but promised to do her best after less than five minutes she returned to me and offered me a seat at the window but emphasized that my actual seat had much more legroom so i stayed the rest of the crew seemed to be cheerful and happy too special requests by other passengers were dealt with professionalism i brought my own snack and water along which was a wise thing to do as the catering notservice was slow the new procedure takes too much time and let passengers disappointed as their choice is running out quickly ba should reinstall the old system again the cabin was spacious but the aircraft showed its age the flight took off with a delay of 20 minutes but was a the gate at terminal 5 15 minutes before scheduled arrival time

 dublin to london 421 euros for the worst business class flight you can imagine business class with no extra leg room just the middle seat blocked off outbound from dublin around lunchtime i was hungry and all they had was some ham dish and nothing else i was told i had to order a kosher meal if i did not eat ham so i practically had nothing to eat the stewardess was kind enough to give me some bread and a snack however i was looking forward to a decent meal after forking out for a business class flight so i ordered a kosher meal for my return flight i got the kosher meal but it was vile some sort of salmon that was tasteless very poor experience ba should not call this business class as it was worse than a low cost carrier
 flew british-airways from london gatwick to orlando contrary to a lot of the other reviews i found the aircraft and staff on board to be fine sat in 24 d on g notviio seat was comfortable and big enough with a decent amount of recline i agree the ife is not to the standard of other airlines but it was watchable and had a fairly decent amount of content on it the staff were all friendly attentive and helpful so no problems there inflight meals were the typical chicken or vearian option plus a sandwich was offered shortly before arrival
 british-airways from aberdeen to london heathrow the service was what you  expect from a bud carrier like easyjet or ryanair the only difference that the price was 150% more expensive easyjet offer a service from aberdeen to london gatwick for around £50 return this flight cost myself and my girlfriend £160 each there were no complementary snacks offered we had to pay £60 each on top of that for our luggage to be added to the hold the only reason we flew british-airways was because we had a connecting flight from heathrow with another airline british airways use the excuse for the high fair and no frills because of the fees they have to pay at heathrow i do not buy it though our connecting flight from heathrow cost £420 each and was a 14 hour flight yet a 1 hour and 30 minute flight with ba costs £220 each how does that work
 london heathrow to toronto british-airways has been the airline our organisation has chosen for our staff for years when they fly the routes offered to our business destinations recently as the director i have been ting complaints about service cleanliness and comfort from several members of my staff which i have listened to but have been too busy and really had not listened properly exactly what ba seems to do british-airwayssed on my personal experience this recent trip to toronto summed everything up for me firstly after paying around £1000 extra each for a premium economy seat for each of the three of us travelling unlike competitors ba does not provide priority boarding you line up with all the other economy passengers when on board you are met with smiling staff some immaculately dressed others who look as if they have had a british-airwaysd night so who manages quality and standards premium economy offers a little more space than economy however that is about it service levels in the cabin are minimum food is unexceptional and to be hst is a disgrace compared to the price and towards the end of the flight you are offered a second drink and 'a biscuit' delivered with all the fanfare of a 'gold british-airwaysr' being delivered however the discontent and upset on my flight by passengers in premium economy was both palpable and vocal and staff could not have cared less other companies such as air canada offer a superior experience for the same price ba management need to  their act toher otherwise many customers such as my organisation are just on the edge of abritish-airwaysndoning them completely familiarity definitely breeds contempt but ba really is taking the biscuit with this and some of its other products the marketing image does not match the reality ba ground service and management at toronto is appalling staff sitting around passengers british-airwaysgs missing delayed no  to help staff being openly rude and dismissive a thorough review is needed

 berlin to london what an embritish-airwaysrrassment our national carrier has become a laughing stock german passengers with us were amazed that all items of refreshment had to be purchased each transaction took a long while being paid by card two elderly male flight attendants were british-airwaysrely able to service a full flight within the time available the refreshments on offer were limited british-airways used to epitomise service and quality : it is now just like any other cheap carrier
 london gatwick to pisa i fly this route often and this flight was my first out of the south terminal its not as user friendly as the north  not and meanders around up and down  not all over the place could also do with a refurbishment we approached the new ba lounge which is easy to miss not being in the best place in the terminal with reservations as everything ba does nowadays is cheap and skimpy pleasant surprise  not its pretty top notch good food and plenty of booze nice and airy with spacious seating we wondered for a moment if we had wandered into the wrong lounge all good so far then the flight was called and our new found love affair with ba quickly receded the walk to the gate was miles it took us 15 minutes  not and needed a bit of a run as well arrived all nice and sweaty plane was busy and we had the front row the best seats usual disappointment with the lousy seats  not economy masquerading as business seats plane old and dirty the wc was disgusting  not dark and dingy and the bowl  not well i dare not even try and describe it here  not save it looked like the previous person had not flushed it  not leaving a permanent effect took off on time my wife had the sandwiches  not which she said was dry and tasteless i settled for a couple of gin and tonics you do not expect much nowadays from ba and therefore you are disappointed  not before you  a chance to be disappointed crew were fine  not and do not like the ba cost cuts as  said we spend half the flight apologising to passengers they also said charging economy customers for food had g down like a lead british-airwayslloon i did notice during boarding two passengers bringing their own food and drink on board disgraceful
 london heathrow to phoenix i have been flying with british-airways for years although i have not used them recently i was surprised at the service or lack of service our national carrier has turned into the worst the crew are nce and friendly so no real complaints apart from on a 105 hour flight during the day they were nowhere to be seen until about 15 hours before landing the food was absolutely appalling for dinner we were offered a choice between meat and vearian i had chicken filet which was as hard as leather with some sort of indistinguishable brown gravy and totally tastelessthe chicken was served sweet potatoe mash and a pea purée this was the only thing edible on the plate a tiny beetroot salad the obligatory hard as rock bread roll for dessert a small piece of chocolate browniecomplimentary drinks were out of sight so most people did not realise they could ask for wine etc a small container of water was on the traythis meal was served about 2 hours into the flight and then nothing again to eat until roughly before landing at which time was served a folded slice of pizza served in a box a packet of crisp and popcorn all carbohydrates and a small container of water i tasted the pizza and it was tasteless and just like cardboardso i left it and took the crisps and popcorn with methen tea/coffee was served  i am not expecting a gourmet meal but there was no thought given to the food provided on british-airways there was no fruit no salad or proper veables there were no soft drinks offered or any proper serving of even the british-airwayssic water the flight entertainment did not exist a couple of new films the rest were old or unheard of the music/radio audio was the same with no new music or unheard of artists my daughter booked this expensive direct flight for me to my destination in the us i have asked her not to book me on british-airways again i  rather travel on virgin or delta indirect this by far was my worst ever experience on flying long distance on any airline and quite hstly i just could not wait to  off

 london heathrow to bangkok we had already flown ba10 from bangkok to london a month ago so were really hoping that we got better seats in the crazy business class seating on this route of course we had to pay extra to reserve the seats but wanted to make sure we were toher so booked j and k seats check in at lhr was good lounge at t5 was packed friday afternoon and i was not happy that we had to be bussed to flight no priority boarding and when bus arrived the whole herd boarded into business class door and we could not even  to our seats on boarding toilet in business class was out of order with a scribbled note stuck on the door why was not it fixed prior to the flight for some reason throughout the flight people were coming into business class to use the toilet which angered me as staff did not stop them constant queues for toilet with  not in action and other cabin passengers using the business toilet not good enough food and wine were ok and crew were good flat bed was good disembritish-airwaysrking was slow same movies as ba10 four weeks earlier
singapore to london heathrow  not after reading the negative reviews and the press about ba of late i was not expecting much at all from this trip terminal 5 is a breeze and has to be  of the best things about flying with ba we checked in and cleared security within 20 minutes we secured seats on the upper deck of the a380 which seemed more intimate than if we were on the lower deck seats were comfortable for the journey and entertainment fine ba cabin crew seemed rushed throughout the journey lead purser was busy talking when guests were entering the aircraft no hello from her or acknowledgement once we got to our seats there was no space left in the overhead lockers no help from cabin crew but did not expect any either they just looked on and told us where not to store our british-airwaysgs food was kept to the british-airwaysre minimum for this 135 hour journey with 2 hot meals provided at dinner and breakfast nothing in between i was actually surprised to receive the second hot meal for breakfast we got more food and snacks on our qantas flight from singapore to australia which was much shorter at 7 hours i still cannot understand how ba are considered a 4 star airline qantas also a 4 star airline was much better in all i was not disappointed with ba as i prepared myself for the worst i  only fly them again if i can score cheap seats
 london heathrow to stockholm arlanda ba is rapidly becoming a bud airline at premium airline prices i'm a silver card holder and have always chosen to fly ba primarily to maintain it not any more it's not worth bothering with the galleries lounge at heathrow now the hot food has been replaced most of the time with sandwiches and cakes the small touches like the takeaway biscuits etc have g too and i'm now on my fourth time of having to stay an extra night at my end destination because there are no evening seats on the flights  not even 6 weeks ahead it's hard to raise a smile from many of the check in staff/stewards  not they do not seem to care anymore the last time i flew premium economy the food was inedible just about to book with another airline on principle i have to say i hope ba ends up learning the hard way that saving pennies will lose them pounds when customers leave if you're going to be a low cost airline charge low cost prices
 bangkok to london heathrow boarding was the usual farce with unintelligible boarding announcements resulting in a free for all the flight was packed full the inflight entertainment system did not work for the entire flight  not this is a 13 hour flight and also with time spent on the ground waiting for push british-airwaysck nearly 14 hours i have noticed that ba do not seem to care about ife not working on ba0009 and ba0010 as it has been quite usual on this route for some passengers to be complaining but this time it was an aircraft wide problem effecting all passengers the captain made a number of announcements apologising and asking passengers for patience and explaining that it was not the cabin crews fault they were obviously experiencing passenger dissatisfaction he explained that the system had overheated  not well that calms things i do not eat the served meals on board due to becoming very unwell on a previous ba0009 flight i never want to experience again so i was looking forward to eating the snacks which are usually available however i was told they had been withdrawn  not i was not happy but had brought a sandwich from the airport so although felt very hungry i managed but remembered how well eva air compare with sandwiches and even pot noodles between meals the cabin crew were nice but after serving meals stored their trolleys between the two aft toilets next to the rear doors both sides of the aircraft effectively blocking access to all the 4 toilets passengers wanting the toilets had quite a struggle to push past them i have never seen or experienced this on any flight and wondered if this is actually a safety concern ie blocking doors i also experienced sinus problems pain and congestion which is i believe due to the air quality on boeing 777 airplanes the air being very dry with little humidity i do take precautions but it has taken a month to recover from the terrible headaches sinus pain and congestion i only experience this after flying on 777's and there are flight crew forums on line discussing 777 air quality problems the captain was on hand to apologise for disembritish-airwaysrking passengers and was clearly annoyed that the plane was not fully serviceable i complained to ba and also emailed ceo alex cruze having been urged to do so by the crew my email to the ceo was forwarded to customer services no surprises there customer services who replied quickly investigated and confirmed that there were time constraints loading food and a full compliment was not loaded hence no snacks i was advised that the lack of ife  be investigated by their maintenance team they  not acknowledge any problem with the air quality but i did not expect them to by way of compensation i was given 3000 avios points which to me is paltry especially as those points have been radically devalued for economy passengers they are worth a third of what they were a year ago and can only be used where avios are accepted frankly i am disappointed in both the flight and ba's level of compensation i have tried to stay loyal to our national carrier but currently have no confidence anything will be d to improve the passenger experience on this route the only way to check is to fly that route again with ba do i risk it  therefore i will be looking at all options in the future including middle eastern airlines with a plane change
 istanbul to london i am sad to say british-airways is little more than a bud airline masquerading as a really very expensive  it hard to see any difference between my flight experience on a bud airline and british airways except the ticket price my disappointment is so high because i had high expectations i paid extra for a more comfortable trip and instead felt totally ripped off every possible shortcut is taken to ensure your discomfort and their profit margins i have not flown british-airways for years and i shocked by how much it had g downhill it is riding on its once good reptutation and short changing customers save you coins for something else you do not  what you pay for with british airways
 belfast to seoul via london heathrow pretty poor short haul connection to london was good before you had to pay for food and drink and genuinely felt like there was more leg room than the long haul flight from london was very cramped i'm slightly above average height but by no means a giant and i really struggled to  comfortable seat was too narrow very little leg room and the space to put my feet was taken up by what i assume was the processor for the ife system for the seat in front the seat was very narrow and got pretty uncomfortable after around 2 hours the food was ok nothing special not very much of it and the thimble of drinking water you  every few hours is hardly enough as a child i remember the food on ba flights being very good but something has g terribly wrong staff are  of the few things ba has going for it at the minute  of the few things left from the ba of old when it was actually worthy of the name friendly staff on the flight and in the airport flew the same route with qatar airways a few months before and they were quite simply in a different league one last note you build this terminal 5 which is meant to be world class firstly there is no smoking area although we're constantly being told not to smoke many people still chose to you expect people to wait in your terminal for hours on connections and we ca not even enjoy a fag in the process though it seems the toilets are an unofficial smoking area as you're normally met with a wall of smoke when you walk in i am not some who can walk into an airport and buy a rolex and a gucci outfit like most people i recommend you set up some shops where normal people can actually afford the things in them rather than just window shop 
 paris to london heathrow i am a ba gold guest list member with 75000 tier points i cannot believe what is happening to ba the attendants and crew look embritish-airwaysrrased to be offering such a poor quality product cramped seats chaotic boarding every flight announced our flight is busy today so if you want to check british-airwaysgs in other words they have crammed in so many seats there is no room for cabin luggage now you pay for food and even water two trolleys pass very slowly down the aisle because it takes so long to serve and pay for food or drink effectively blocking access to the toilets for the whole flight how can they let a cost notcutting ceo with no understanding of quality service run a premium priced airline it is appalling and this is no more than a high cost carrier with low cost service  not a shame to be called british this airline is in terminal decline and i need to look for matched status from a proper premium airline do not pay for ba shortfall use cheap alternatives its the same service
 world traveler plus from heathrow to sfo the only whinge we had with the experience is that the new entertainment system had to be re notbooted  boarding was pretty much average with no z boarding for economy just everybody  on  first time in premium economy and we loved it where ba shined was post notflight i did the unforgivable and walked off with the wrong checked british-airwaysg  discovered it 3 hours drive later got contacted by staff at ba luggage and in spite of the mess being entirely my fault immediately volunteered to fedex overnight my british-airwaysg to me  also having just come from a cruise on a line famed for its food the food stood up surprisingly well compared to oceania's
 buenos aires to london i was warned that ba had g downhill but i decided to give it a try on this long haul flight to start with you cannot reserve your seat prior to check notin unless after paying over 2000€ for a business class ticket you are willing to spend some additional 90€ per leg to have your seat reserved i call this insane to be hst so i waited and waited and waited till check notin opened and made it to  a forward facing aisle seat latam lounge in buenos aires was nice food average but connecting from santiago i had the time to take a shower with ground crew extremely nice and attentive boarding was sort of a mess as ba let frequent flyers not flying business board through the business class door so there was a flood of people moving british-airwaysck and forth to  to the rear of the plane; crew simply unable to handle this process so you did not feel like being taken care of during boarding aircraft was a 3 notclass boeing 777 not300 and looked a bit tired seat was the absolute worst part of this flight as it is narrow too hard to have a nice sleep and for aisle passengers this configuration feels like having a wall on  side and being exposed to people/trolleys passing through the aisle on the other side; once flat it is a little short too even for me i'm 180cm high no giant here and narrow so you find yourself forced to sleep on a side; in addition to that when you lie down the drawer is not accessible therefore you have literally no space to store anything not even your glasses if you wear them food was just ok i still ca not understand how ba can run out of entrée options in business class crew very mature for such a long trip but friendly and nice it really shows they are suffering from these cost cuts as they keep apologizing for everything that is not available or not working entertainment system made me smile a bit as the selection of movies was ok but the screen was much smaller than some other carrier economy class s to sum up it was an average flight if it was not for the lie notflat seat i  call it more a premium economy experience than a business  ba needs to improve business class as they are well below par if compared to almost all european carriers not even to compare the middle east airlines 
 gatwick to pisa check in at gatwick a breeze chaotic boarding process though flight took off approximately 10 minutes late the cabin crew were exceptional and are  thing that ba have going for them middle seat vacant in business class but in reality no extra leg room in the seats and if the passenger in front decides to recline you have even less room as for the catering ba are ting this wrong why are they insisting on dumbing down on their once reasonable standards i hardly call 'cheese on toast' a satisfactory meal choice despite calling it croque monsieur it is still cheese on toast what ever way you look at it  i hope mr cruz reads these reviews it is not what the customer wants ba are turning into a high cost no frills airline so much for their motto 'to fly to serve' remember mr cruz and mr walsh there are other airlines offering a much better service
 flew british-airways from london to dubritish-airwaysi to start with awful seats i felt like i was being squashed by both passengers on either side of me need more room then it was rude staff i was shocked to top it off when the host came around with the the food he completely skipped me and was working his way british-airwaysck when i interrupted him to ask for food he got annoyed with me when i moved my seat british-airwaysck after they had removed the food trays a man behind me hit my chair and started yelling at me i'm a female travelling al and i felt frightened by that just shows how little space every has been given i'm really disappointed with ba
stuttgart to london with british-airways how things have changed passengers now queue at gate as with easyjet or ryanair rather than sitting and waiting to be called unsurprisingly boarding in stuttgart by agency staff was chaotic  not unsure who was entitled to what cabin crew increasingly young and inexperienced probritish-airwaysbly because older members have left in view of the transformation of british-airways to a bud airline how visible this was few people bothered to purchase the over notpriced snacks and drinks on offer once that was out of the way the three cabin crew members gathered in the rear galley chatted and munched away at the spare food from the business class section which had been surreptitiously taken to the rear at the rear i noticed that  of the two lavatories for economy class has now been ripped out and replaced by two seats without window directly opposite the  remaining toilet those passengers looked particularly unhappy  not not least because of the constant queues alongside them everything about british-airways now is shabby telling passengers how little they are valued and this does not even mention the extra costs for hold luggage and for seat reservations my ticket theoretically gave me a choice of seat but at the appointed time there were only four choices left so no i wo not be flying them again unless all other options fail
" flew nice to gatwick £300 for a sandwich in club class we travel in business class whether long haul or in europe for a better experience this is even more important now since the quality of service in economy has nosedived under the 'stewardship' of señor cruz it started british-airwaysdly when we discovered once more that the flight was not at the terminal but in a remote location that required much waiting on a bus just like a charter flight i asked a staff member why this was so to be told that the terminal was too small to cope but i noticed low cost carrier norwegian was parked on a jetty we had booked seats in the second row as we wanted a choice of hot meal  not those at the rear of club often have no option due to catering limitations passengers were offered a choice of a curry i think yum or salmon yuck by the time the nice crew got to us only salmon was left this is high in potassium a fish i must avoid i asked why the other dish had run out by the second row only two were loaded was the reply what; two only for the whole of club yes i asked what else was on board only to be told that i  have to pay £3 for an m & s sandwich from economy before some help from our avios the tickets cost £50000 it was beyond belief that an executive card holder should be treated this way the very nice cabin crew were excruciatingly embritish-airwaysrrassed ba should wake up before once loyal passengers swallow hard pun and migrate to other carriers i'd rather fly easyjet and spend the £300 change on a nice meal

london lgw to lima booked to fly out in premium economy and british-airwaysck in business overnight i like bas website that allows you split classes like this in the event got upgraded to business both ways no idea why i am not a frequent flyer flights left and arrived on time gatwicks sunday morning check in scrum is awful all ba cabin crew and ground staff very polite and helpful food very good outward slightly poorer quality of meat on return but that will be the peru catering supplier cabin clean but plastic partitions and carpets are looking a bit tired ife screens are old and small plane was g notymms both ways hate the ba penny pinching that even when you have paid £1600 they still want another £60 to pick a seat
 punta cana to gatwick return i  really like to say a good thing about my recent two flights with ba but can find nothing the layout of the business class cabin is so british-airwaysd with half the seats facing british-airwaysckwards that you have some staring at you when the little divider is not up the seats are extremely narrow that you cannot easily turn when they are in the sleep position and they are so low that it is almost impossible to  up from them in more than 50 years of traveling i have not been in a worse business class the selection of films and music is limited and the screen small the food on the two trips was passable but nothing more and the wines less than passable unless you like plonk i do not suppose it is much fun for the flight attendants to work in such a low class environment but they did not  thing more than was absolutely necessary i have saved the best for last because on the return flight the temperature of the cabin was close to freezing and i wore two pullovers and a blanket and was still cold i know that many former ba customers have been bemoaning the fall in standards aboard and i regret that i join that group that will if possible never fly ba again
 washington to london heathrow return british-airways seems to be having an identify crisis are they a full service or a low cost carrier the meals have been cut british-airwaysck to almost nothing seat selection fees abound and checked british-airwaysggage fees may apply depending upon the the type of ticket purchased united airlines now has a better trans notatlantic coach product than ba food: on the outbound overnight flight breakfast has been reduced to a granola british-airwaysr on the return flight dinner was tiny small amounts of food in half notfilled bowls presented on a large tray as if to emphasize the lack of food and the pre notlanding snack has been replaced with the aforementid granola british-airwaysr given the lack of food ba should just switch to buy noton notboard so at least fewer people  go hungry flight crews seemed apoloic about the lack of food seat fees: i do not know of any other full service carrier that will not assign a seat in advance as part of a paid ticket just assume it will cost you another $40 or more per ticket on ba luggage fees: completely opaque policy on our outbound trip we were told our tickets included  free checked luggage item on our return we were told checked british-airwaysgs  be extra although the kindly british-airwaysggage check notin attendant waived the fee for us no doubt he too is as much a victim of ba's indecipherable british-airwaysggage fee policy as are passengers entertainment: boeing 777 not200 outbound with good modern on notdemand ife system on the return a boeing 747 not400 the system was an older on notdemand system with small blurry screens that were almost unwatchable cabin crews were generally friendly in fairness both our flights were on time and nothing went wrong but ba just feels cheap and stingy will likely fly the competition in the future
 new york jfk to london heathrow return my review is british-airwayssed on three different criteria: service food and seat comfort overall the service was very good the flight attendants were very attentive throughout the flight and very professional any request was handled in a timely manner the flight was full but service did not suffer the food on the flight was absolutely disgusting and inedible a choice of thai vegatable curry or a chicken dish which i ate  bite of the highlight of the meal was the two bite chocolate granache also they have eliminated the second meal/snack service  not all they served was tea/coffee and a cookie very poor indeed seat comfort was the best i've experienced in economy i managed 4 hours of sleep on a 7 hour crossing the slideable headrests allow your head not to bob if not for the disgusting food i  give a 9/10
 malaga to gatwick the seat had british-airwaysrely any legroom and it reclines only 1 or 2 degrees  not impossible to relax food and drinks including coffee and water are now being charged and the airline only provides  trolley for whole plane we were sitting in row 28 of 30 and it took us nearly 2 hours to be served and only cards are accepted which makes things worse appalling if you want to fly like this fly ryanair for a fraction of the price
 stavanger to las vegas via london heathrow this is a salute to the fantastic staff at terminal 3 helping my group out when everything seemed lost because of american airlines terrible customer service the trip was originally meant to be a codeshare where we flew with ba booking under aa flights from lhr to las via jfk the trip took place on april 3rd 2017 we risked being stranded with 16 out of 19 travelers at lhr because of aa somehow magically losing our itineraries and not interested at all in helping rather blaming every else the ba service personnel spent hours trying to solve it and  decided to take matters in their own hands they got us 16 travelers on their direct flight from lhr to las the day after arranging for accommodation transport to/from the airport and dinner / breakfast even though aa was mainly responsible for our journey the service on notboard was to expect from a economy flight of that duration seats was good food all right complimentary drinks and very welcome the ife was great the screens was a little small compared to other newer aircraft's for this type of long haul but no particular issues
 flew with british-airways from london heathrow to moscow return over easter 2017 the plane was old seats cover reminded me of unclean grey carpet on the way to moscow had seat next to emergency exit so had some leg space though the screen for entertainment as well as table were ting stuck so had to choose between watching film and having food resulting with the food provided placed on my lap and cup of coffee on the floor the food itself was miserable  not st notcold cheese and onion sandwich without alternatives whereas the crew had hot lunches with meat as i noticed while queuing for toilet and there were only two for a fully booked economy class on the way british-airwaysck to london had a seat in the middle of the cabin with so little leg space that i literally could not even cross my legs as my knees were stuck into the seat in front seats were not reclining either the food was even worse than on the inbound flight  not st notcold cheese and onion sandwich was replaced with st notcold cheese and onion small bun and hot drinks were only served once over 4 four hours flight do not fly ba to russia it employs tactics of easyjet albeit the latter is superior in comfort and customer service
 copenhagen to mexico city via london heathrow upper deck window seat british-airways uses a 2 not4 not2 configuration with every second seat british-airwaysckwards to serve window and center seats the crew open a blind between the seats and pass food and drinks over the aisle seat it also means you will be face to face with the passenger besides you this could be great or horrible food is nothing special but service is polite bags did not make the flight but their representative on ground was very helpful and british-airwaysgs arrived next day i had to pick them up myself would fly again as usually have good fares to mexico
 gatwick to rome return outward flight the plane was full booked and paid for an aisle seat but no legroom and narrow seat did not eat on the aircraft landed on time return flight left rome late again full this time i booked and paid for aisle seat near emergency exit  not more leg room food on the plane was from m&s chose the ploughmans option having looked at the glossy catalogue the food bore little resemblance to the photograph  not dry and not filled i feel sorry for the cabin crew as it takes them ages to serve the food receive payment you ca not use cash and then clear it all up passengers near the rear of the aircraft  be lucky to be served british-airways european flights are nothing more than a no notfrills airline so much cost cutting it opens the door to look at other cheaper options offering the same service this is not good enough
 prague to london heathrow british-airways have lost the plot ba is now a bud airline and offers the british-airwaysre minimum of services for a higher than bud fare check notin is ridiculous as you wait for all the other categories to be processed such as gold members bronze members families business class silver members they do at last  round to calling for any left and then it's a scowl from the shabby attendant as you board the plane seating is fair though leg room is tight the flight left a little late but arrived almost on time which was fine there is no food nor even a coffee provided and a couple of flight attendants come down the aisle at a snail's pace with a trolley i ca not believe ba now make passengers pay extra for food and drink ba shows itself up as very much a bud airline and a fr cry from its illustrious past i wonder what has happened to ba for it to have fallen so far this will be my last flight with ba unless there are no other options available as ba is more expensive than its direct bud competitors and not a full service airline anymore
 london to istanbul i am ever increasingly disappointed with british-airways the constant penny pinching is having a material affect not only on the hard product but the staff who seem dispirited the seats lounge food aircraft cleanliness on board food and beverages all are sub par compared to rival airlines my most recent flight british-airwaysck i took an aisle seat for a change the flight was quite full and there are a constant stream of people from the economy cabin coming through the business class cabin to use the toilets this is really quite irritating especially during meal service no attempt was made by the crew to stop this or even close the curtain splitting the cabins even after complaints i find the aircraft consistently dirty and on this flight some had left chewing gum on the seat as well i think ba do not care on the flight from istanbul electronic devices are british-airwaysnned other airlines allow them up to boarding and then arrange for them to be taken off you british-airways has not even bothered to offer entertainment or even extra magazines on the flight they really do not appear to give any care for their passengers even those flying business class
 paris orly to new york via london unlike some american carriers and some other european carriers there is no beverage service on short haul flights tea costs 230 pounds  economy overseas is a joke too they bring the premium drinks/service from the british-airwaysck to the front so economy class passengers  to see the kind of amenities they could have had they replaced the 2nd meal they used to offer with snacks but of the options cookies snack notsized kit kats and snack notsized mars you may only have  i asked to have an extra snack i was told no only  onboard media is decent but nothing to write home about i classify this airline as slightly above a bud airline you do   meal after all and entertainment but not much better than that 
 los angeles to london heathrow i have to agree with all the other reviews on here ba have g so far in cost cutting that the service the flight attendants are able to offer is just appalling there's just nothing positive left to say about them from the newly refurbished 747 that looks drab and cramped with the new uncomfortable slimline seats to the disgusting cheap meals the flight attendants were pleasant but you can see they're embritish-airwaysrrassed and have nothing to offer all this  be fine but british-airways still charges premium prices and for what i just took a flight on the same route with virgin atlantic and what a difference all the little extras that make long flights bearable are still there and the prices are cheaper i'm afraid to say i wo not be flying ba anymore unless it's to use up avios i'd acquired
 london to milan linate i landed in london after taking connecting flights from orange county california to dallas and then dallas to london both on american i landed in london at 1:15 pm this flight did not leave until 6:30 pm i went to the british-airways help desk and asked if i could  on the 3:00 flight they told me to go to the gate and wait to see how full the flight was before the flight as i had only  carry  and nothing checked i went to the gate just before boarding and they told me that it was impossible as i  have had to go to the ticket area at least an hour before to change the ticket so i had to wait another 3 hours i have now been traveling for 18 hours at the gate for boarding they looked at the british-airwaysg and said i  have to check it i explained that it is a regulation carry on british-airwaysg and it was on the last two flight and i have had the same british-airwaysg on over 30 flights as carry on i explained that it was on the last to connecting flights and i have been traveling for a long time and did not want to wait a long time for my british-airwaysgs as i will be ting in late they were very rude and tagged the british-airwaysg but still gave it to me to carry down to the tarmack and  on the bus to the plane i decided to carry it on to the plane it fit easily in the overhead as it has for every other flight there were other british-airwaysgs that were bigger than mine they actually came on the plane and took the british-airwaysg off and put in in the cargo hold if that was not annoying enough i could not believe i asked for water to take a pill and they charged me for a bottle of water they also charged the woman next to me for a cup of tea i could understand this possible on  of the discount airlines but this was british-airways to end my frustration it took almost an hour to  my british-airwaysg as the belt stopped halfway through the process i am a travel agent and will never book for some else or myself unless there is no other viable choice
 london to nice return british-airways has g down no more food on board arrived in nice and it was 1 hour before we foudd our baby's buggy in another section altoher no  informed when returning no buggy arrived at heathrow  not my two year old is now without a buggy and no  knows anything i was told three different messages we have the buggy we do not have the buggy terrible service all round the airline has g down and staff really do not care  not especially in heathrow british-airwaysggage office they simply do not cater for families or care
" baltimore to nice via london my ordeal started when i could not check in online i called ba and they said the flight is under airport control and i have to check in at the airport fair enough but i should have known something was wrong when i  to the airport 3 hours ahead i wanted to  a good seat i was told that premium economy was overbooked and that i was involuntarily being bumped to economy never mind that i bought and paid for the ticket 4 months ago the staff were not even nice about it quite beligerent they offered me a compensation card for $94 where they got this amount i do not know i  have preferred the seat then they tell me i need to contact ba for a refund of the difference in price why should i need to contact them they moved me they know they moved me should not it be automatic so i am being inconvenienced twice because of their mistake i did send an e notmail on their refund form and have yet to hear from them it has been a week i had a horrible flight i have severe british-airwaysck pain  reason i booked premium for the extra room which was made worse by my economy seat my screen did not work for movies although the flight attendants did try it is as though they wanted to make me have a british-airwaysd trip fast forward while in france i tried to use the compensation card declined  so i tried to use it on amazon and nespresso online also declined really ba i sent another e notmail telling them the card is not working nothing i have flown ba in the past and have been happy with the not anymore  i have had it with ba i will not fly with them again because when there is a problem they do not come through

 a business class sale convinced me to give it a try on a trip home from sofia to boston i have to say that my wife daughter and i were completely pleased somewhat surprisingly so quick efficient checkin at the business class counter in sofia decent contract lounge excellent service and food onboard both the club europe flight to london and club world flight to boston terrific flight attendants and much better food than i am used to on united lh or austrian i have a gluten allergy and need to order special meals all three gluten free meals on this trip were among the best i have had all three included flavorful sauces which is something lh always omits from its special meals the galleries lounge in the b satellite terminal was excellent not as much food on offer as in the lh and os lounges or even the new ua lounge at heathrow t2 but it was quiet and comfortable and we really liked the quirky club world business cabin the middle section is great for couples every seat has a storage drawer and the entertainment system was solid there were four toilets for business class my only complaint: the outrageous policy that required me to pay to reserve seats toher in business class as the fight was not full i probritish-airwaysbly could have gotten seats toher at checkin but i did not want to take the risk and ba got additional revenue which is obviously why they do it
 an excellent experience on a roundtrip trip from hong kong to copenhagen through london despite being in economy class the flight attendants were attentive and also proactive serving our needs before we even needed to ask they were friendly and made us feel completely at home the on notboard entertainment selection was very extensive with high notquality options english and international movies of high caliber and the screen interface was modern and easy to use the seats on the flight from hkg notlhr on the boeing 777 not300er were new and much more comfortable than the average older seat the pilot was incredibly descriptive of the flight path we were taking and kept us up to date in terms of turbulence arrival time weather without being overbearing or overly disruptive with regards to the pre notboarding/ground service  of the check notin representatives went out of her way accommodating my boyfriend and i so that we could sit toher and have a window seat both of which were not available at check notin due to the fact that we had bought our tickets separately and had not selected seats beforehand we really appreciated her willingness to look at what she could do to make our trip more pleasant this was not my first time flying with british-airways but it had been a long time since i last boarded a long nothaul flight with them and the trip exceeded my expectations british-airways in my opinion is not the outdated carrier that many deem it to be 
 london heathrow to larnaca british-airways used to be a good airline now it is just another expensive airline with low cost service the ticket prices are still very high but they do not offer any food or drinks any more for short haul flights also they do not let you to choose a seat unless you pay really dissapointed
 flew london gatwick to san jose costa rica we have flown business on numerous occasions and have noticed the decline in british-airways the service on this flight was appalling travelling as a couple we were sat in the centre seats which the cabin staff appeared to ignore when offering any of the cabin services ie drinks towels etc the normal routine stuff on too many occasions we had to request attention chosen meals were not available on both outward and return flights and we were sat in row 2 at the front of the service collection of waste items had to be requested the galley kitchen was not restocked and by the end of the flight looked like a bomb site no glasses or cups were available for even a glass of water cabin staff were noticeable by their absence during most of the flight hot towels will soon be the size of a postage stamp toilet british-airwaysgs are cheap ba have totally lost the plot they are no longer a premium service and willie walsh and co need to take a flight on emirates qatar etc to realise their failings business seating configuration is ridiculous passengers in the centre seats have to hurdle their way to the isle over the isle passengers legs as part of the same trip we made domestic flights to connect again service is in reverse but the costs are not if ba wants to become a bud airline then they need to offer bud fares i do not think they have a clue what they are doing in future we will avoid them unless absolutely necessary the only positive of the trip was the lounge at gatwick the lounge at san jose is a joke
" the flight from new york jfk to london heathrow was extremely uncomfortable although the entertainment was quite good on the tvs the food was horrible plasticy tasting and above all not tasty the flight from heathrow british-airwaysck to jfk had many delays although this was out of any's control it was very inconvenient and there was a terribly long wait to board the new plane 5 hours at first we were told that we  be brought to a new plane as soon as possible but almost an hour later here were many other delays and disappointments that we were notified about the other passangers and myself should not have to wait for hours to  on a new plane i wish the discomfort of the plane british-airwaysd food and time of delays were reduced dramatically so far not a good first trip on british-airways

" very very poor customer service from british-airways myself and my partner were on a flight that was overbooked and so were accommodated on a different flight on the same day with a via point of oman while upset about the change of trip and the delay that  occur as a result we accepted that these things happen and were told to go straight to boarding for our flight to oman when we asked about tickets for the second flight we were given a form of ticket and told we  have to visit the transfer desk in oman to  our boarding passes on arriving in oman they had no clue who we were and the flight we were meant to be on was full we were left there for 4 hours with no communication from any in a transfer unit with no shop or vending machine and no offer of refreshments after pleading with airport staff we were placed on a flight to bahrain and transferred to our original planned destination new delhi we were approximately 12 hours delayed arriving and did not receive a single apology that day to say it was a traumatising experience was an understatement

 i had to change my flight british-airwaysck from san diego because of an accident that required a stay in hospital i'd flown out first class and had a business class return i do understand why some fare structures mean that flights are not changeable but ba were absolutely no help at all they flatly refused to change the flight so i had to buy a ticket in the only available class  not world traveller plus which cost $3300  not  way the first class fight to was ok  not nice cabin crew and good food but grubby cabin and clear cost cutting  not no snacks water etc in the galley like there used to be absolutely no help on the return trip  not despite requests before the flight  not because i was walking with a stick i'd requested an aisle seat had to ask again at check in as they had given me a seat in the middle which  have really annoyed other passengers as i tried to  across them to go to the loo etc with my stick really poor value at $3300 and rubbish seats uncomfortable and tv screens that are not great the food was awful  not clear that costs are being cut massively maybe their plan is to offer such rubbish food that when they introduce food you have to buy in long haul we all feel grateful it's a pity really it's obviously bas call if they want to be a no notfrills airline but i'd rather they were hst with us so that we can choose amongst the many other no frills airlines but they keep trying to say that ba is a leading brand with strong values when clearly they've decided to cut costs wherever they can but still charge high prices might make them profitable to be a follower in the short term but i suspect people will vote with there feet and fly with some else
 philadelphia to edinburgh via heathrow in january 2017 i've always enjoyed flying british-airways and usually make my yearly trips to philly with them rather than flying direct to newark via united the long haul flight was ok  not food service was a wee bit slow but it was the usual chicken and rice which was ok for an economy class flight however it was a surprise to me that they no longer served breakfast or even a snack in the morning  not so the chicken was the only food we got on the flight i was not too fussed about that until i got on my connecting flight to edinburgh where i found out that they no longer served free food by this point i was pretty hungry so i caved in and got ready to pay for a british-airwayscon roll which never happened because the trolly never reached me to top it all off we left heathrow late because of a computer problem meaning i missed my train connection in edinburgh  not but i understand that these things happen at times however recent cuts to service and the upcoming densification of the long and short haul fleet make ba a lot less attractive furthermore the headph jack on my ife was loose so it was quite difficult to watch films during the flight which was disappointing on the up side the staff both at the desk and during the flight were great as always considering i got the flight for a good price it was ok although i will definitely not be going out my way to fly ba and will just go for the cheapest or direct option in future i'm indifferent in recommending flying with ba  not if they suit you best then go ahead but do not go out your way to fly them  not if there are cheaper or direct options just go for them instead because there is not anything particularly outstanding
 well where do you start this is a business seat on a supposedly premium brand the ticket price was in excess of £5000 the lounges at lhr t5 need work yes british-airways are investing but long overdue the small lounge for b gates needs to be re notthought and offer better food options to the aircraft  not its been refitted apparently but should be scrapped the seats remain tired the vanity screen was not working properly the entertainment system is past its best with smudges and scratches the carpets look like they need a very good clean and are grubby indeed the toilets are 'old' overall the aircraft is well past what could be described as a premium regarding the crew  not they have been british-airwaysshed and are a shadow of their former selves sad but true too many apologies for the rubbish decisions of management on this trip the galley kitchen was poorly stocked and many of the usual items were missing eg waitrose fruit and yogurts they have also stopped the ice notcream food served was not good  not saving grace was the meat platter but what could you do to spoil sliced meats and cheese blankets are faded and ragged the toilet british-airwaysgs are a joke cheap and nasty this route was the jewel in the airline crown and  that has slide down the priority ladder ba need to invest in a new fleet re notenergise the crew change the catering and  a few more choices upgrade the seating and change seating configuration to avoid being an olympic pole vaulter
 london heathrow to singapore business class flight from heathrow to singapore flight took off over 2 hours late with no real explanation why and we were not kept informed it seems ba is these days later in taking off during the flight i felt like many of the staff serving were not friendly as   expect in any flight let al in business class and my calls to request additional water or other quite british-airwayssic service elements were not responded to with any friendliness or a service mindset the main meal we were served was absolutely awful it was supposed to be an asian meal of a curry with prawns but was just like gunge and was not edible i really do not know how they could have deemed this meal acceptable also the breakfast was far too late and seemed to be a big rush to try and complete the service before the plane landed  not which seemed totally unnecessary as i was hungry between courses i went to the galley to  snacks but the selection was poor and the staff seemed to react british-airwaysdly to this for some reason i have noticed a big difference of the snacks on offer in the past few years i have been a ba silver member for many years but now see no reason to renew i always try and fly qatar where possible when going to asia now as the service is better and often the price too there is nothing redeeming about ba
 what was i thinking flying this airline for the second time travelling this airline our luggage has been lost two years ago london to dublin our british-airwaysgs were lost for two days so this flight our british-airwaysgs are left in london again now i'm stuck in dubritish-airwaysi in winter clothes missing the pools and beaches at our resort waiting for our british-airwaysgs to turn up it's only been 3 days now in the same clothes upside  not service on board ba559 was excellent however business class on ba europe flight is no different to economy so do not pay for business if you think you are ting a comfy seat
" just got off the flight from heathrow to new orleans and have to say it was  of the worst long haul economy class flights i have ever had to endure the legroom is an absolute joke for such a long flight  not first time i have ever been unable to open my laptop to work i now understand why they do not offer wifi on board the seats are minuscule and if you are unfortunate to be sitting next to somebody who is rather big bd shall we say then it is a dreadful experience in my section  of the toilets was not working from the start of the flight and the other toilet rapidly descended into a disgrace with no cleaning d throughout the flight i have travelled a lot over the years first business and economy and had a gold british-airways card but this was just terrible and i do not really know what ba hope to achieve in the long run  not i can guarantee i will seek other airlines first before considering them again anybody contemplating going to new orleans from heathrow  not fly with somebody else and  an internal connection  not you wo not regret it as for ba they have about as much chance of me booking another flight with them long haul as trump has of winning the nobel prize for oratory were it to exist

 we flew on a reward flight from london heathrow to brussels for a weekend and decided to treat ourselves to a full service experience  we were very well looked after by superb flight attendants who had a great sense of humour the lunch was chicken salad and a nice dessert what we did notice is that the legroom was just the same as economy and seemed rather worse than usual the only perk we had was a blanked off seat in the middle which if you are a bit chunky like me it was quite difficult to manoeuvre this all tallies with what has been written in the newspapers and we like many other reviewers and frequent loyal flyers feel that ba is being turned into vueling if it were not for the excellent pilots and flight attendants on ba who make our journeys feel very comfortable and safe we  not travel on ba we  try to find another full service airline because we enjoy flying 
 the cabin crew british-airwaysr  lazy individual were excellent t5 feels like a monopoly  not galleries lounge food is simply appalling between breakfast and lunch there is no hot food unused hot food is removed at 930am sharp why not leave it  so all you have is bread and stodgy croissants the upstairs of the a380 was in need of a serious clean cabin crew friendly although you can sense lower morale ba flights are often late now in my experience the club world a380 seats are not comfortable despite every knowing crossing over some's legs too  out is still a nuisance there is a scrum it down for last use of toilets before landing  not i had  bloke shout at me when i'd been waiting long before him and he'd just turned up and tried to arrogantly british-airwaysrge in  many long term loyal passengers are starting to feel disrespected and undervalued let down after years of loyalty and serious spending we're not ting what we're paying for although charged that's the sad bit
 i am just sad to have to write this review i changed from lufthansa to british-airways more then 10 years ago because it beening a premium airline that was superior in any way mostly flying between berlin the us and in recent years very frequently cape town ba had more modern planes innovative products like a great rather new first class lie notflat seats in business class a new premium economy and a very good economy with good seats and legroom flying from cape town to berlin in january to keep my silver status made me realise that n of my initial reasons to choose ba still exists with the exception of the great cabin staff that i feel really sorry for the owners hired álex cruz last year a very experienced low notcost airline executive and he is doing the best he can: turning ba into a low notcost carrier unfortunately the result is a pity no more service on short haul flights reduced service only paid snacks on long nothaul worn 747's to cape town and the grimm outlook to be traveling in cramped in 777's with and extra seat squeezed in from next year onwards british-airways as a premium airline is lost realistically for year to come even with my status renewed i do not think i will fly them again if i do not have to meanwhile i understand that companies sometimes unterstand and correct their mistakes i do hope ba will do so in the hopefully not to distant future  not and keep their great staff on ground and on board
no no no british-airways you've messed up some sat in an office thought it  be a good idea to charge for food and drink on flights just like many other airlines do and they said let's provide food from m&s: that will make our offering classier than the rest the problem on my 18:55 flight from marrakech to london was that — it being dinner time — loads of passengers wanted food and drink so the service was inevitably snail notpaced a piece of friendly advice ba you need to provide 4 cabin crew to handle economy on a dinnertime flight or you merely annoy your customers sitting near the british-airwaysck of the plane my wife and i got served 2 hours into the 35 hour flight by which time our tongues were hanging out but what's this only two sandwiches left and we british-airwaysgged the last two packets of crisps you're promising things you ca not deliver ba there is such as thing as advertising standards and your beautifully photographed food and drinks menu drives a coach and horses through the principles of advertising standards the 2 cabin crew serving economy soldiered on with their service most impressively even managing to smile as for the umpteenth time some's payment card failed to register on their machine hint for frequent flyers: if your card just does not work you  your food and drink for free meanwhile behind the service trolley a phalanx of passengers with their legs tightly crossed tried to avoid exhorting the cabin crew to move their trolley so they could access the toilets to relieve themselves a very appropriate expression in the circumstances other passengers simply wanted to relieve themselves of the packaging of the food they bought hours earlier: several of them eventually came down the aisle waving their empty bottles and m&s extensive food packaging for the crew to remove from their sight whoever at british-airways is employed to read reviews on this website please take note and pass it on to your management if you dare the process i call 'ryanisation' of british-airways is almost complete you now charge for checked british-airwaysggage yes i know that's indirect but only idiots ca not see through the scam you exert an extortionate price for those unfortunate enough to be tall and who need the legroom of emergency exit seats and now you've devised a marvellous system of charged cabin service for food and drink on 'short haul' what even ba used to call 'medium haul' flights that annoys more than half the customers on board the plane oh and by the way: why do not the cabin crew deploy the a320 overhead monitors that display the flight progress too costly perhaps i suggest that ba needs to return to the days of advertising when you had a wonderful slogan but with a minor revision: british-airways the world's least favourite airline
"having only flown easyjet / ryanair for all my short nothaul journeys over the last 10 years or so i was pleased to see a relatively low notcost ba flight for my round trip from london to rome in hindsight i wish i'd booked a different airline and not booked ba british-airwayssed on its legacy reputation to say that this was a disappointing experience  be an understatement i expected at the very least an equivalent service to that of other low notcost short nothaul airlines certainly not worse narrow seats are to be expected but these seemed far more narrow than the norm regardless of this there is no excuse for a seat being so uncomfortable even on a 25hr trip this was almost unbearable coupled with the fact that at a relatively small 58 my knees were grazing the seat in front lucky the seats had no recline feature to make matters worse i was also tantalised by the ba bragging of m&s supplied food i am more than happy to pay for this on a short nothaul flight and do not expect anything for free it certainly looked delicious from the pictures and descriptions sadly being sat in row 22 this meant that after the frustratingly slow pace of the cabin crew finally ting to me meant that they had run out of pretty much everything no sandwiches no fruit salad no yoghurt i asked what they did have their response 'bottle of water or a kit kat' after asking the cabin crew why there was so little option their response was surprising to say the least 'they never give us enough food it's mad they give us 6 sandwiches for the whole flight' needless to say that ba can no longer live on their past reputation they had an opportunity to position themselves as the best of the low notcost carriers sadly they probritish-airwaysbly sit about 4th or 5th down the list i'd say i'd give their long nothaul a chance but after this experience i wo not bother what a shame

❎ unverified |  london heathrow to munich return it used to be an enjoyable experience flying ba sadly all the cutbritish-airwayscks are kicking in now and travelling ba just feels like a bit of a chore the loss of the free british-airwaysr/food service on european flights is a real step down even worse is the cynical way in which it happened: downgrading the food offering so much that it seemed like an 'improvement' to offer paid notfor m&s food on board oh and how replacing my free drink with the same drink only now i have to pay is an 'improvement' in service is beyond me not even a free tea or bottle of water i asked for tap water on a flight earlier this year to avoid paying only to find it tasted of chlorine  not  not recommend you do the same the 'card notonly' payment system is chaos as well it takes forever for the trolley to  from  end of the plane to the other next on the list is the outrageous prices that ba charge to select a seat in advance not wishing to pay this by the time i checked in for this flight the maximum 24 hours in advance there were only 5 or 6 seats on the whole plane i could choose from i took the sole window seat available right at the british-airwaysck of the plane which is far from my first choice of seat other carriers let you select seats at check notin for free and easyjet charge about half of what ba charge to select the equivalent seats in advance and if you pick  of the 'preferred' seats with easyjet you also  priority check notin and boarding for your my  not not so with ba check notin at t5 was also a hassle on this occasion as the first check notin machine  not work at all and the second printed a boarding pass but  not let me print a british-airwaysg tag so i could not use the british-airwaysg drop counters after all and had to queue up at the check notin desks wasting time there was a minor delay due to fog but that was not ba's fault and did not have a hige impact flight itself was pretty smooth and cabin crew were good on the way british-airwaysck our business meeting finished early so we tried to take advantage of the  remaining real 'pro' to flying ba in europe with standard economy fares  not the ability to switch between flights for free on notthe notday could we no the earlier flight was full rather than sit in munich airport all afternoon we rebooked on lufthansa instead in summary if flying ba on european routes these days be aware that ba is now a no notfrills carrier lower your expectations to this level and you'll probritish-airwaysbly have a pleasant flight
 belfast to gibraltar via heathrow return i fly british-airways when i can and have always been impessed and satisfied  not until now the flight from heathrow to gibraltar was uneventful clean aircraft no delays no issues  not apart from the lack of drinks / snacks i'd love to know who thought this  be a good idea flying short haul there is nothing to differentiate ba from easyjet or other no frills airlines add to this the lack of choice on their menu there are only a couple of sandwiches and if you do not like mayo or cheese you're out of luck well d ba you've alienated loyal customers and are hardly likely to attract new s the flight from heathrow to belfast is my main gripe the flight was meant to depart at 1645 but was delayed to 1720 hardly a big deal right wrong the gate only went up at 1650 this led me to a bus which took us to the aircraft it was 1730 before every was boarded again hardly a big deal except that we did not take off until 1830 which meant that my dogs had to spend an extra night in kennels as i was british-airwaysck too late to pick them up the flight itself was full which  not have been too british-airwaysd if there had not been a lady sitting a couple of rows in front of me who stank i wo not go into details but she smelled rancid i was a few rows british-airwaysck and so did not  the worst of it but i could see others who were closer who were not having a good time at all needless to say i did not enjoy the flight at all i  go so far as to say that it's probritish-airwaysbly the worst flight i've been on and i've flown monarch and easyjet i did e notmail ba with my concerns but they did not bother to reply so again well d ba you're squandering customers good will toward you like you're burning fifty pound notes
" flew from gatwick to cancun british-airways have lost their way front line staff are still excellent but behind the scenes customer service is now at an all time low the quality of aircraft and seating is below other airlines they need to sharpen up their act before even more passengers desert then

british-airways has got it wrong on short european hauls malaga to gatwick and if you are seated at the front end of the economy class the food / drink trolley will block access to the toilet seated at the tail end of the plane the food is very likely to run out on my flight the promised m&s was limited to snacks £180 water £120 kitkat credit/debit cards only no cash and this meant a very painfully slow service one working toilet for the economy class the other  was out of order  not but the business class toilet at the front was out of reach for the cattle class leaving me wait for over an hour i was not allowed to use the  working toilet at the british-airwaysck of the plane for about 80 minute a combination of food trolley blocking the aisle then of air turbulence the cabin crew seems desperate to  the 1 trolley hence the slowness to the end of the cabin people needing the toilet was obviously not a priority they certainly did not let me pass during the 40 minutes or more without air turbulence ba has g cattle
london to new york it has been a long time since i have been on a british-airways flight and time has not been kind t5 at lhr is cavernous and reasonably easy to navigate once you work out where things are it just feels a bit hit and miss compared to changi or hk the flight itself was on an old b747 new seating and ife but very old the boarding process was chaotic extra security checks at the gate itself hardly surprising seat comfort was ok albeit very tight and narrow the ife was great and that was the highlight the lunch served was so so but having eaten at the lounge it was left largely uneaten the biggest problem is the staff morale they all seemed to be keen to  the service out of the way dim the lights and disappear evidence of cost cutting in that water was only provided if asked for any wine was by the glass very cheap cutlery etc ba is a premium airline but looks to be offering a ryanair standard compared to the me or asian or my usual ride qantas ba have slipped significantly shame as it was a great airline to fly with at  time
" flight from gatwick to grenada return with british-airways lounge in south terminal was good flight and staff were good decent food and the plane was clean what i struggled to  my head around is after paying for business class flights ba then expect you to pay an additional £77 per person each way to reserve seats there were 4 of us traveling so that adds in excess of £600 to our flight cost ba will tell you that this is free 24 hours before departure but actually 3 days before departure most seats had g i  expect after paying for business class that you automatically  seated toher but it appears not as there was  couple on the return flight who had not reserved seats after paying for business class and were made to stand in the galley until everybody had boarded to if there were 2 seats toher

 flew from lisbon to london and return british-airways never fails in terms of being on time but i will end my business with them after more then 30 flights and having said very good things about them in the past they seem to be cutting corners with everything passengers are not given even a small cracker and for some strange reason the plane does not stop at the hub just goes to a remote stand and takes forever to  to the terminal not worth the my spent
 amsterdam to cape town via gatwick on our 13 hour night flight i discovered that my seat was broken and could not recline spent 13 hours sitting upright while every around me was in a reclined position complained to crew but as they were unable to solve the problem they advised me to issue a complaint when i returned home to amsterdam this is exactly what i did ba replied that it was unfortunate that i had a british-airwaysd ecperience and offered me a gbp25 gift voucher as it woud be unfair to other passengers if they gave me more what an insult its unfair that i paid the same price as the rest of the passengers that's unfair they do not want to communicatie with me anymore regarding this matter very arrogant and not customer friendly at all i feel cheated british-airways obviously does not value their customers a gbp25voucher woud be adequate for a short trip during the day but for a long overnight flight its an insult sent 2 e notmails but they have decided they dont want to communicate anymore 
 i was scheduled to fly ba208 from miami to london on january 18th boarding and departure went normal but than close to take notoff the ordeal began captain announced a technical problem at approx 09:15 pm and that's when the horror started overall we ended up sitting in the plane until 01:00 am before we were finally allowed to leave the plane any attempts to fix the fault failed we were given accomodation but that was a 45 mins drive from miami airport check notin took another 30 mins due to a long queue of stranded passengers and the place was like a freezer was re notbooked for a flight the next day but downgraded from premium economy to economy old tatty 747 very uncomfortable seat and entertainment screen was the size a mobile ph worst of all the delay of  day has forced me to add another night in london and cancel my connection to munich total additional expenses not counting the difference between premium economy which i paid for and economy was ~$500 including the gap between economy and premium economy probritish-airwaysbly ~$900 now this is where a service oriented company  have an opportunity to make a difference submitted my compensation claims incl proof for the above expenses as per protocol online  not no confirmation followed up with a call had to wait approx 45 mins to talk to a human and was told that most expenses are not refundable but i  be compensated for the remaining no further confirmation email etc was paid a mere $50 into my account with no explanation what this is supposed to be for the expenses were $900 decided to do some research and it appears that under eu law airlines are required to compensate for consequential damages if the delay if more than 3 hours my delay was 21 hours  absolutely atrocious customer service lousy product how on earth ba deserves 4 stars in beyond me
 london heathrow to los angeles worst flight ever with british-airways you can see why they have fallen out of the top 10 very lazy and oblivious staff members they ran out of food during both meal times we were promised a replacement but nothing came until they cleared away the trays all we got was oh sorry and a re notre heated meal after leaving the service light on for 15 minutes looking for some water i went to the british-airwaysck of the plane to find 2 members of staff reading the paper even after complaining to customer service after the flight we were not treated much better if it was not because for the avios program it was enough to put me off for a life time
 i have never had such a british-airwaysd experience with british-airways before the cabin staff were rude lazy and obviously did not want to provide a service the flight was from mauritius to gatwick on sunday 26th march 2017 landing monday morning 27th march no second cup of coffee offered at breakfast we had to take our own plates british-airwaysck before landing and on two occasions the steward pointed to a cloth on the floor and expected me to pick it up without a please or a thanks food was good the staff were absolutely appalling we pay good my for business class and this chaotic and rude service is not what i expect from my national airline
 london heathrow to hong kong the new premium economy seat is a vast improvement on the previous seat but i was hugely disappointed however with the inflight offering for a 13 hour flight in a premium economy i  have assumed it  be similar to others offering meals mid flight snacks and other bits i was very wrong we had a british-airwaysr service and meal there was then nothing until breakfast exactly the same as the economy offering this is appalling british-airways has really g downhill with its measly service offering i went to speak the crew at the rear of the aircraft they completely understood customer frustrations they just have nothing to give ba was once a carrier you looked forward to flying with not so much anymore the crew were friendly but even they seem to have lost the passion they once had for any flying ba bring yourself some additional snacks onboard especially if your travelling with kids
 frankfurt to hong kong via london this will definitely be my last time with british-airways i have already changed my return ticket to cathay pacific the business class experience with ba has suffered so much cost cutting they are well below every major competitor short flight to heathrow and the afternoon snack was pitiful  not probritish-airwaysbly worth about $3 at most seat legroom is awful and not far off the 29 inch size that economy is being cut to staff onboard were friendly and that is all lounge at t5 was again very poor  not crowded food choice and standards like a cheap motorway café dirty and nobody seemed to be cleaning the toilet was disgusting evening departure to hkg and went british-airwaysck into the terminal to find something proper to eat onboard the ba club world product is lousy  not cheap low quality amenities a very poor meal choice and standard washrooms unstocked and quite dirty the cabin worn and scruffy as an expat living in germany i have remained loyal to ba until now but this is the last time i will waste our company my using them it is quite clear that ba are abusing their monopoly situation at heathrow cutting their own costs to boost shareholder returns without giving  thought to the longer term reputation and profitability of the airline if you are undecided about choosing ba over another airline quite simply do not consider ba  not you will be very disappointed and feel cheated
 london to nairobi return in february during the industrial action we found the crew to be friendly and attentive the food was ok i had the spicy chicken which i did not much care for it was rather unusually british-airwaysdly prepared with great hunks of chicken and veables just not as nice as the beef my husbritish-airwaysnd was eating on the return flight we were 2 flight attendants down due to the strike but they were excellent and more than made up for the missing staff i know that there has been a lot of gripes about ba downgrading its services but these flights were really good and that there were lots of drinks runs during the sleep time did not much care for the cereal british-airwaysrs but the 2 cups of tea made up for that

london heathrow to edinburgh on british-airways domestic economy check in at t5 okay although a little slow fast track security quick i used the ba galleries north lounge which was full but okay with hot food on offer in the mid afternoon boarding through a8 on to a clean looking full a319 i had seat 25a which has no window crew where actually very friendly as is normally the case on ba not a very pleasant flight due to turbulence but landed just about on time british-airwaysggage off quickly so flight not too british-airwaysd the footnote to this trip is really my feelings towards ba in order to maintain my executive club silver status oneworld sapphire i have to take 4 ba flights each year which i can do on domestic routes but the additional 16 or so european and international flights i take each year will be either with other oneworld carriers or others and not ba the management at british-airways are making false claims when suggesting it's what our passengers asked for i travelled with ba 16 times last year and i wasnt asked if i wanted a devaluation of the ba executive club  not or was i asked if i wanted to pay a huge extra charge to book specific seats  not i most certainly was never asked if i wanted the simple snack and a coffee on uk and european flights replaced by buy your own food  not neither was i asked if i mind paying for snacks on international flights unfortunately british-airways are fast becoming a second rate bud airline in order to appease it's shareholders"
 toronto to berlin via london on miles in a mix of classes first class check in at toronto was good with friendly staff a fast priority security lane had me in the first lounge in 15 mins unfortunately first lounge was full of gold card members and so had to sit in the biz lounge good menu to eat on the ground and decent selection of wine and beers fast boarding once it started and greeted at the door and taken to 2a excellent rose champagne served by friendly and professional crew a weird but tasty starter of a cured / dried salmon followed by steak which was well cooked good cheeses and all courses selected were available after some decent sleep a fast breakfast served as late as possible ended a decent flight t5 north lounge was packed with a 20 min wait for a shower which are now looking tatty and dirty decent breakfast selection of hot rolls fruit cereals etc quick board for the flight to berlin ridiculous leg room  notat 30 inches max very cramped do not like the table in the middle and several couples asked for them to be removed an ok snack of cold meats though stingy portions on time arrival and fast british-airwaysgs finished off a good and cramped outward leg returning to london in economy was possibly the worst short haul flight ever including low cost airlines a full a321 was cramped insufficient bins with  out of service and the now infamous terrible leg roomi understand this is to  even worse when ba moves to 180 pax on an a320 in line with charter and low cost carriers slow food and drink service with little take up some could not buy as no cash accepted not even juice water and coffee offered for free this penny pinching denying you even a glass of water makes the us and canadian carriers look high class the only saving grace were great crew who were embritish-airwaysrrassed by the product they had to deliver the whole plane looked fed up subdued and just waiting for the hell to finish final leg to toronto on a 777 included a bus mystery tour to a remote stand nice crew who were efficient and offered decent service poor lunch of roast chicken weird mash and overcooked greens not biz class food and pretty average more like economy food afternoon tea was fine with a fast deplaning and british-airwaysgs on the long haul legs the ife was identical to christmas poor choice little new material  not clearly even the ife is now down graded the biz class product  not once cutting edge is in urgent need of a revamp if only to  rid of the 8 across and lack of privacy how the mighty have fallen experiencing four classes on four legs showed the gulf in all classes between ba and competitors on both short and long haul the short haul legs to / from berlin are worse than bud airlines where at least you know what you're ting and it's reflected in the fare and extras with less leg room fewer toilets reduced quality and/or no refreshments and a general downgrading of service the only thing not reduced is the price this suggests that the ba exec and iag only care about the bottom line and not the customer or reputation of a once world class airline the only thing left to strip customers of is the exec club and avios it's only a matter of time before this final nail in the ba coffin hits the customer at which point  not i'm off hello star alliance
 this will be my last time to book a trip with them i booked a return trip for april 2017 from london to istanbul a few months in advance they ended up cancelling my 11:00 flight and moving me to the 07:00 flight which  not work for me after the agent telling me to take time to work out a plan i left it for a few months on calling yesterday they told me that i had accepted the changes as it was months ago i told her that the other agent suggested that i wait and decide later this was followed by the fact that i had purchased a cabin british-airwaysg only fare but i travel with a ipad or laptop with the recent electronics british-airwaysn ba were going to force me to pay £50 for a british-airwaysg to check my device although this was not my fault to add to this everything is paid for now reduced legroom pay for seats and no way to change them even on check in i can see no reason to fly ba any longer i called my travel agent who was able to cancel my trip for a small penalty i have rebooked with turkish airlines who was only a little more cost at last minute they include food checked british-airwaysg drinks and seat selection and sometimes a boeing 777 on this route
" heathrow terminal 5 is a great airport dedicated to british-airways the check notin service was not as fast as they say it was normal the ba staff on the ground were cheerful and happy to help i was very excited to fly on the new dreamliner from london heathrow to dubritish-airwaysi but my dreams were crushed within my first few steps onboard first the ife felt very old and not clear at all something you'd expect on non notrefurbished b777's choice of movies and tv shows are pretty good so i ca not fault ba on that the seats are nice the head rest is excellent and leg room is okay cabin crew are lazy and just do not want to serve us i was waiting more than 7 minutes for some to come to my bright light hovering above my head the food is okay your first meal its hot and options were good two meats and nothing more you could ask for on a plane however and this is a big however your second meal we were given a breakfast bar that was disgraceful how much of a bud are they on now i thought maybe something happened to the food so they gave us breakfast british-airwaysrs instead but on the return journey we were given a cookie for lunch people were laughing and looking at their cookies in disgrace i just ca not believe how downhill ba has g it's incredible how the airline now charges for shorthaul flights too i think they're running out of my unfortunately i booked my flights to marrakech before this expereince and i promise that  be the last time i fly with ba

 british-airways use a version of the 747 with a minimal number of economy seats on this route from london heathrow to johannesburg every seat on both outward and return flights was occupied they make a bigger profit by having more seats in business class etc and so squeeze the economy class people into a confined area seats are narrow seat cushions are hard and i had a large person next to me both trips i paid for an aisle seat in each case but comfort is impossible food was passable and no more but there were two meals on the long flight cabin crew were surprisingly young and seem to be in training  not polite and efficient but they had obeyed the instruction to disappear for most of both flights both flights on time these ancient 747s are showing their age even though both of these had been revamped they looked tired but clean the alternative aircraft used on this route is and airbus 380 but a fellow passenger said that the seats were even tighter on that aircraft it is tiie that ba started to compete and not be so complacent
 i am 73 years old was scheduled to fly from montreal to heathrow on january 30th and from there to athens on february 1st where i  catch another connection to cyprus i was delayed in montreal for 5+ hours never given a reason why stuck in the aircraft from 9 pm until 3am cause customs was closed had to wait another 6 hours at heathrow missed my connection to athens and my connection from athens to cyprus was never offered accomodation or compensation had to book another flight on february 2nd and book a stay at a hotel close to athens airport contacted british-airways they replied with the usual vague comments i followed up and never got a reply clearly i am being ignored i will never use british-airways again
❎ unverified |  flew british-airways from london heathrow to innsbruck overall just about ok for value for my its a route where the price difference between economy and club is often no more than a £100 which is just as well because: outbound slow check notin overcrowded lounge in desperate need of refurbishment particularly the horrible toilets no priority boarding all bussed like sardines on the long journey to t3 where the plane was sat on board flight early nice breakfast good cc return no lounge no voucher to compensate for no lounge no priority security no priority boarding cc again good on board and an ok lunch seats same in business as they are in economy business ticket meant skis carried 'free'  not which  have cost £70 or so in economy
❎ unverified |  london heathrow to dublin booked business class expecting extra legroom but seats are the same as in economy i was and still am disgusted what a rip off how do they  away with it answer people like me pay excessive air fares to fly with them well not any more disgraceful they should be ashamed
 london to dublin i had not flown with british-airways for over 12 months but recently made the mistake of booking with them to fly out to dublin from london heathrow terminal 5 it all started again i had downloaded the ba app from the apple app store and i tried to check in the night before using the app but i was ting the error message saying that it was not possible for me to check in at that time i thought nothing of it and tried again in the morning when i was sat in the taxi to the airport on the app i noticed that the flight had been delayed by approx 1 hour and some minutes considering it is a local flight and i was flying with hand luggage only i decided to stop so that i can  some food as having flown multiple times in the past 3 months at least once and sometimes twice every week i was under the impression that as long as i am at the airport an hour and 15 minutes before the flight then there should not be any issues after all that's the whole point of flight updates when i got the ba self service machine with 55 minutes remaining in the original flight timing and almost 2+ hours before the actual flight time i had issues printing my boarding pass and was told by the helper to go to z e to  a boarding pass printed by the counter staff after waiting 20 minutes in the queue bearing in mind that the flight was delayed by an hour and so there was still over 15 hours remaining until flight take off i was told that the flight has been closed and as i was not there an hour before the flight time they can not help me and i ca not fly on that flight so i will have to take the next  from 8am flight i was moved to 11am flight after discussing with the check in manager i was told that there is nothing he can do as he does not make the rules needless to say that i had to book onto the next flight despite being through security and in the waiting area over an hour before the actual flight took off if this is how the ba customers are to be treated ie they have to be there on time for the original flight despite ting notification that the flight is delayed then i for  will most definitely not be flying ba again the rules are to be helpful towards the customers and not  way traffic as it seems in this case they are not putting any value on my / other customers time ie we must wait inside the airport like idiots despite knowing that flight is massively late 
❎ unverified |  london to barbritish-airwaysdos having used avios points when making the reservation we were very disappointed about the high charge to reserve seats in advance the crew were very pleasant and the aircraft was reasonably clean but there was choice of main meal available british-airways policy of offering a fun size mars british-airwaysr instead of a second meal is unacceptable in our opinion the airline are offering a bud experience at a premium price and we will not be making any further bookings with them
 london heathrow to bangkok first time flying british-airways i had heard all the british-airwaysd reviews about them and they did not disappoint tired old aircraft seat  not fully recline unlike the person in front of me entertainment system is dreadful and flickeered most of the trip  not i did not even use it much in the end food was good i will give them that check in very fast and efficient plane pretty much on time no wifi or charging facilities onboard
 flew british-airways from beijing  not london heathrow emerald member so a  minute check notin with a dedicated counter was appreciated the bgs lounge which ba uses was a welcome surprise owing to the fact that there are many japanese food options at that time jal also shares the lounge business section almost the same as first albeit more people boarding seamless here is where the value ends two meals for 11 hour flight but if requesting snacks in between you are directed to a copy of highlife where there is a sweet treat menu with sugar family items priced around £2 not3 each i declined that and stayed hungry the meals served were carb notrich pasta tasteless and a rice meal dry tasteless i have minimal needs but i do know ba has cut british-airwaysck so much now that it really is drink + meal + drink + meal on trans notcon flights crew were friendly enough free exit notrow seats for friend and i emerald benefit
 flew from london heathrow to geneva fast track through security at lhr terminal 5 is a misnomer if you want fast track choose an airline departing from t2 or t3 boarding aircraft a nightmare no priority boarding at gate herded onto a bus in conditions that resembled a cattle truck line up on tarmac and steps to board on board seats arranged for benefit of british-airways flexibility and not the convenience of passengers three seats each side of the aisle with the centre  blanked out no extra seat width or legroom knees against the sear in front unless  sits with a twisted spine not good similar arrangement on newer british-airways a320's overall not what  expects from business class and negates any positive aspect of the flight
 montreal to london heathrow flight and service was cheap except for the price i expected better and this was not value for my advance seat selection is expensive just plain gouging on top of ticket price it is complimentary on air canada even with boarding pass pre notarranged there is no bag drop in montreal just  long line british-airways ba staff air canada next time
 gothenburg to san francisco via heathrow returning from phoenix  ba now charges for snacks and drinks in eurotraveller a move that surprised me as ba is now nothing but a very expensive ryanair or easyjet after arriving in london we started out with a 5 hour delay due to a mouse spotted onboard our shabby and worn boeing 772 planes were swapped and we left on yet another shabby and worn b772 seats were comfortable but the aircraft was dirty ba has cut british-airwaysck on the amenities in world traveller it used to be a sleeping mask socks a tooth brush and headphs now only headphs were provided returning from phx on an even older b747 overall i was disappointed a couple of years ago i switched to ba from lufthansa as i find london a more convenient transit airport while both airlines offering the same high levels of service but what has happened this used to be a great airline which now sadly is nothing more than a low cost carrier charging premium prices will switch to lufthansa from now on
 gatwick to mauritius 12 hour flight delayed 1 hour due to no cleaners advised by first officer that cabin crew had to clean the plane crumbs on seat and greasy windows otherwise fairly average flight until woken up 2 hours out of mauritius to be advised that toilets on plane were full and no further use please just after waking up most people like to visit the toilet surely anyway seatbelt signs then illuminated though little if any turbulence one hour out first officer came on again with further abject apology re toilets not working as apparently the toilet tanks had not been emptied at lgw before departure two hours with legs crossed for over 200 pax surely flight should never have departed without emptying tanks trust they maintain the engines better
 san diego to london an excellent flight with really good club world service from crew the crew in the upper deck knew their jobs anticipated requirements and smiled when delivering service no complaints and a decent nights sleep they knock us airlines into a cocked hat and i should know as i had the bitter experience during my stateside trip
" flew british-airways from london heathrow to dubritish-airwaysi i do not normally write reviews but i was so disappointed with the service and flights from ba for a recent 4 night stay in a dubritish-airwaysi with my wife that i had to make a comment some of the staff not all were rude and they had run out of food when they came to serve me will try and use other airlines in the future wherever possible

 amsterdam to gatwick was the usual short haul commuter flight no difference in seating apart from the empty seat in the middle of three seats no apparent additional leg room compared to economy class onward flight to st lucia paid for advanced seating allocation as did not want to travel facing the british-airwaysck of the aircraft tired worn interior and the food reflected this too outbound crew were helpful and eneric keen to assist where possible and were prompt to attend when the call button was used inbound flight was the same tired interior unappealing menu and indifferent service the only redeeming event was that my reading glasses and pen left on board on the outbound flight were returned to me 5 days later when i travelled home 10/10 to british-airways staff in st lucia for managing this so well i hope that ba will be renewing its fleet soon it will not be my first choice of carrier for long haul travel until some investment has been made
 my last few experiences with british-airways have been extremely disappointing they just do not offer the level of service that customers used to enjoy on my most recent trip from london to toulouse i booked using my avios points i then had to cancel the outward trip for personal reasons and was charged extra to do so so i ended up spending more on 1 flight than i had for 2 they now charge for food and drink on shorthaul flights i even had to purchase a bottle of water this is akin to a lcc such as easyjet but the fares are still much more expensive in addition i received an email from the airline saying they had tried to contact me and could i contact british-airways about my booking i had received  missed call with no message during working hours having eventually dug out the right customer services number these were not provided on the email i tried several time to  through on but was left waiting so long i eventually gave up
 edinburgh to luanda via heathrow british-airways has started charging inflated prices for food on a flight that is already highly priced in comparison to other airlines the standard is pathetic and it is no surprise that the flight was empty they are just a very expensive easyjet / ryanair
 london heathrow to las vegas never had need to write a british-airwaysd airline review before now british-airways was the worst airline i have ever flown with old shabby and dirty plane tv screen was broken and hanging off the british-airwaysck of seat when i arrived the only nice crew member for the whole flight managed to move me the seat i then sat in was dirty and had dirt on the seat british-airwaysck old food stains and on the belt no drink served with meal except water when i eventually went up looking for a drink they had no beer at all and only had a little wine left i had a white wine when i asked for a second yes only a second drink on a 9 hour flight i was told they had run out of wine also i had to have orange juice awful and rude staff with exception of  worst airline by far i have ever flown with

❎ unverified |  flew gatwick to san jose costa rica return with ba at a very good price of £1200 return for both of us the flight out was a typically cramped atlantic crossing and my wife and i were separated and unable to sit toher the cabin crew were professional and there were lots of complimentary drink runs the food was average at best and lots of options ran out during the flight on the way british-airwaysck the plane left 90 minutes late the crossing was quicker at 9 hours some time was made up and cabin crew were very good my main issue was that the plane did not seem to have been prepared very well there was nothing at all in my seat pocket not great when you are referred to safety material that should have been there and was not the catering was really disgusting though i was served a veable lasagne which consisted of a suet like stodge surrounded by some runny soup truly horrible and the worst long haul catering i have ever been served i thought that the whole experience was a bit shoddy and average such a shame that the middle east carriers are so much better in virtually every way sad and disappointing
 orlando to london i had booked business class and i wanted to be comfortable unfortunately with british airways i paid all these my and at the end i was having so many issues that made me thinking of not flying with this company again i checked in 24 hours before the flight as soon as the online check in opened the system gave me only a single seat opposite to the direction of the airplane with no possibilty to be able to change it i called british-airways main office to try to sort this out initially i was told that they could not do anything and they sent a note to british-airways at the airport as airport keeps some business class seats i called again the main office to talk to a different person in case i was suggested a different option abd the second officer sent a second note to the aeroport as soon as i arrived at the airport at the check desk i was informed that they had not received any notes and there were no seats available for me however they were going to fix it at the gate when i arrived at the gate i was asked to try myself to ask every other business passager to swap seats i do not feel that it is worth paying for business with british-airways and then ting all this chaos it was finally found  staff who had kindly agreed to asking other passenger for swapping seats on behalf of me finally my lagguage that was 'priority' came out last
 newark to london heathrow this was the first time i have flown long nothaul ba for sometime although i am ba goldcard holder due to my travels on other oneworld carriers the lounge in newark is lovely and mostly quiet although there is no separate first section and food is only offered for business and first passengers super views over the airfield boarding was smooth however the hard product is awful compared to the competition this was a new boeing 787 however the ying notyang seat configuration no air vents high density poor quality food and very little of it very british-airwayssic toilet facilities compared to american business class on the same route a shoe british-airwaysg instead of amenity kit the product is akin to an excellent premium economy and not a business class product flight attendants were ok but just going through the motions i asked not to be served breakfast and just a cup of tea but this was forgotten about the arrivals lounge is grim  not tiny plastic and linoleum shower cabins which are not clean and too small overall very poor and i will not fly with them again unless no other options
 hyderabritish-airwaysd to london i have travelled ba numerous times and had very good experiences up until this past week when i was returning from hyderabritish-airwaysd to london from a business trip and was downgraded a cabin while the downgrade itself was not to so much the problem the manner in which the ba staff handled the situation and the apparent lack of care or effort exuded was extremely disappointing i have had previous experiences of being inconvenienced by changes in cabin fair or cancelled flights on other airlines and in such instances those airlines did a fantastic job of providing alternatives or compensation for my troubles in this instance with british-airways i was very surprised to find that the company as a whole seemed to care not at all for my well being or the inconvenience put upon me when i asked if i could be put on another comparable flight i was shut down and told no this is not possible without any explanation when i then inquired about switching to a partner airline or receiving a refund to book a different flight on another airline i was told again and again no this is not possible after realising that british-airways was in no way going to try and remedy the situation i asked what could be d given the circumstances my answer was a to be handed a £75 gift card and be told that there was essentially nothing i could do about it as the airline was under no legal obligation to provide the service ticket class i had purchased after the flight i filed a claim with british-airways and sent emails to the customer service team hoping that some  have the decency to try and provide some sort of remedy to my less than pleasant experience but i have yet receive even  response only adding to my understanding that british-airways does not value myself as a customer or my business i am sad to say that this painfully british-airwaysd service is likely to prevent me from booking future travel with this airline
" london to chicago in my opinion british-airways have massively decreased in value for its customers both within europe and internationally especially as an economy passenger they are moving more towards being a bud airline there is no option of a free seat selection they charge for food on board on short haul flights on long haul flights they removed a second meal with shabby options of a snack instead of a full breakfast or lunch meal avios and tier point awards have been slashed i will not be flying ba any more and will be taking my my elsewhere

 london to vancouver return british-airways is no longer good value for my the cost of premium economy compared with the quality of service food and the general age of the plane make this a fairly pointless exercise the plane in both directions was old and shabby staff are fine but do not really go out of their way to make it a pleasant experience particular bugbears were the inability to choose a seat when checking in online as soon as it opened of course you have the opportunity to pay an extra £40 not£55 each way to choose a seat beforehand the food quality seems to have declined in the past few years and on a 9pm return flight it took a good few hours to serve the premium economy cabin the tv screens are dirty and small the system had to be reset on the flight out took quite a while for almost double the price of economy i do not think it makes sense to fly world traveller plus on this route
" flew london heathrow to gibraltar this is probritish-airwaysbly the last time that i'll book a short haul with british-airways from heathrow for anything other than a long holiday  not no matter how cheap they make it they ca not overcome the structural issues of long walks to gates delays for take notoff slots long walks british-airwaysck to passport control then long queues as passport control and a schlep british-airwaysck to transport willie walsh was saying the other day how people had to expect to pay higher prices for premium airports  not slightly hollow laugh ba are further constrained by their 2 class cabin configuration which effectively means that the majority of passengers in economy are served by only x2 cabin crew and only have access to the rear toilets on our flight of well over 2 hours this meant that the final few rows did not  access to any food or water until we had begun the descent and the loos were effectively out of use i have no objection to paying for food and drink but ba have got to make it possible to actually be able to do it and use the loos reasonably easily seems like a structural flaw in their offering the other frustration was the lack of enforcement of the carry on allowance which leads to a scrum to  your british-airwaysgs stowed  not it took me british-airwaysck to the early days of easyjet and ryanair before allocated seating so unless i'm lucky enough to be among the pampered minority in the front few rows i think i'll use regional airports and the better general service and available loos that come with a single class cabin  not no matter who the carrier is

" this is my first time flying on ba's a380 daily service between london heathrow and singapore i chose a seat on the upper deck of the a380  not seat 70a an exit row seat located just behind world traveller plus this seat has enormous leg space which allows the passenger to fully stretch out the inflight entertainment was adequate and featured some of the latest movies the classical music selection was severely limited though bbc news was on the menu but ironically it was not available for some strange reason inflight service was british-airwayssic there was only  round of drink service during which cabin crew asked passengers for their drink selection for dinner in other words you  have to order your orange juice/coke and wine at the same time cabin crew came around to clear dinner trays too fast even before passengers had finished their meal throughout the night of this red eye flight i did not see any cabin crew coming around with drinks the lhr  not vce route was operated by the a320 british-airways had recently withdrawn free inflight snacks and drinks for its european routes and passengers are now required to purchase drinks and m&s snacks on the whole ba will  you to your destination safely and punctually with no frills in economy class unless there is a promotional airfare too good to resist i  choose another airline

 british-airways are really trying to take all the worst parts of the bud airlines and make a uniquely poor offering i recently flew with ba from gatwick to marrakech despite the ticket price being twice the price of easyjet the catering with the new m&s food can be described as nothing short of chaotic on the return journey the best that could be offered on a four hour journey was a kitkat cost cutting includes removing toilets is  toilet for 200 people realistic ba
 london heathrow to cape town return this return journey was the worst long nothaul flight that i've ever taken british-airways boeing 747 not400 has been configured to cram in as many seats as possible so with only 2 toilets to cater for the front cabin queues were 5 or 6 people long continuously throughout the flight there was hardly any legroom and while it's good that the seats recline quite a way it's impossible to  in or out of a row without limbo dancing or waking the row in front to move their seats the seats are very narrow so put pressure on my elbows when i was trying to sleep i'm not a large lady only 53kg and the entertainment controller is on the top of the armrest so my neighbour was constantly switching my light on accidentally i gave up trying to watch a movie as the screen was so close to my face i could not focus on it the inflight meal was also very poor unlike the food we had on five internal flights on saa which was excellent british-airways have lost the plot  not fly with some else

 overnight flight from st lucia to gatwick efficient check in lounge at st lucia was pretty dire some snacks provided which were ok plane on time club world middle seats which were a good option for us the food options on this flight were not of the usual standard i  expect of business class the starter of melon and cucumber was poor the chicken main was overcooked and lacked any flavor drinks were good some options missing as not loaded but quality generally good fa's were in the main good but some better than others i was well looked after however the fa attending to my wife lacked experience and it showed overall a good flight on the subject of british-airwaysggage it  seem that few of us with priority tagged british-airwaysggage received their british-airwaysgs quickly mine were almost last
 cape town to london heathrow in an old but well kept boeing 747 full flight flight left and arrived on time what made this flight so outstanding was the crew very attentive and enthusiastic my broken headph was replaced within seconds of me telling  of the crew when my wife's breakfast selection was apparently not available it was rapidly located at a different section and served  not to her pleasant surprise 
 i am due to fly from tehran to vancouver via london heathrow i pre notpaid for my seat and their system assigned a wrong seat i called customer service 6 times and no  helped me the  this fixed british-airways customer service is the worst airline customer service i've seen i  be happy to pay extra next time not to travel with british-airways
" malta to gatwick my friend arrived at the check in desk it was a long queue as the system was down to be told that she had just checked british-airwaysggage in  way she had paid on the way out and the check in online app did not say she had to pay twice for the trip as for the food menu the food is so expensive and it's easy to  a meal deal from airport shops that pay these prices an airline should not represent a country when it's british-airwayssed on profit above it's people at least ryanair etc are hst and cheap british-airways is such a sad reflection on the country as a whole

 london to larnaca sadly british-airways is now a very poor quality bud airline that still thinks it is a top end carrier the aircraft are generally old shabby and dirty the staff are surly and abrupt the seating cramped and uncomfortable i am a business travelled and  prefer to fly club europe but i am not paying three times the price for the same legroom as economy it is a joke  not if the person in front reclines i ca not work  not so how is this in any way business class
 mumbritish-airwaysi to seattle via london heathrow i do not know why i chose to fly ba  not a sense of nostalgia i think going to india this time i decided to go east via lhr and ba seemed a good idea i will not do so again i specifically booked all the flights through ba so as to avoid any issues with transitions between carriers eg having to pick up british-airwaysggage en route the non ba flights were arranged i discovered subsequently with non notpartnered airlines with no instructions or pnr's  not trying to find out what the pnr was in order to  a boarding pass was an adventure as ba checkin staff kept referring me to the next leg of the flight we ca not give you a boarding pass  not its not a ba partnered airline  not but ba did all the booking blank look and total non nothelpfulness try in heathrow i eventually phd and got the pnr and checked myself in with a boarding pass similarly on the way british-airwaysck there was no instruction to the point that ba wanted me to confirm my british-airwaysgs in mumbritish-airwaysi before ting on the lhr flight when i got to the gate the ba staff pulled me to the side and castigated me for not confirming my british-airwaysgs the fact that no not told me to do so seemed to be lost on them essentially despite ba being the travel agent here it seems to be all the customers responsibility to know what to do the flights out were not too british-airwaysd  not fairly empty business class and staff were accordingly attentive aside from the fact that they never had my first meal choice on the way british-airwaysck  not for it firstly  not no overhead luggage space because it was filled with ba stuff  not it was not the 'for airline use only' at the front  not it was row 11 when i asked them to shift that i was met with resentful suggestions that i could find space elsewhere on the plane i was pretty firm but polite on the point that having paid for business class i did not expect to have to go searching for space because they had gear above my seat  not and that i wanted them to shift their gear and provide me convenient overhead british-airwaysggage space d with british-airwaysd grace they then essentially ignored me for the rest of the flight  not an overnight request for a cup of tea i skipped dinner to sleep took 20 mins the breakfast was truly awful  not  of the worst airline meals i have ever had the seats are tight  not i endorse all the concerns of the 2 not4 not2 configuration i'm 6 ft 5 but keep myself fit and i'm not fat i have flown around the world in multiple business seats and the ba version is hstly the worst and most uncomfortable yes its flat  not but its short and tight and lumpy lufthansa ethihad emirates singapore eva thai cathay pacific  not all do much better than this  not even delta and american airlines internationals are much better generally the ba experience is unhelpful uncomfortable and shabby i'm embritish-airwaysrrassed to have my birth nation offer such mediocre services its not because they are so much cheaper than others finally i'm now sitting in  of the ba lounges at terminal 5 and noting that the provision of breakfast is geared towards buns porridge and muesli what happened to the cooked breakfasts they offered four years ago the last time i flew ba overall  not it's sad
 i have flown a lot with british-airways and other airlines and am constantly amazed at ba's british-airwaysd reviews flew from chicago to london the plane was spotless comfortable and well presented the staff were impeccable polite and helpful  not in my view some of the best the only thing i  ask is that they review the food they have certainly cut their costs in particular for breakfast before landing and that was insubstantial overall they continue to impress
 phoenix to london heathrow due to a problem with our ticket which where first class returns to heathrow which i may add both my wife and i checked twice when booking the tickets was dated 12th march instead of 12th february we checked in or tried to check in whereupon the discrepancy was brought to our attention we could not prove we booked correctly or that a computer glitch was to blame we still had to  home the staff tried in vain to change the ticket but were told by faceless managers no nothing could be d we enquired the cost of two economy seats home whereupon we told the two economy tickets  come to an eye notwatering $5092 or £4243 economy to add insult to injury we already had 1st class tickets booked that just needed to be re notbooked to the 12th february no chance we had no choice over a british-airwaysrrel scarcity value i hear you cry no we boarded to find that the flight was less than half full my wife and i were beside ourselves with anger not to the flight crew it was not their fault but they were dumbstruck themselves to cap it all the food on the way home was appalling inedible we will never fly ba again british-airways  not the worlds biggest rip off 
 london heathrow to chicago o'hare and my experience was wonderful there were a few problems checking in at terminal 5 there was an issue with some of the luggage belts at check notin running slow  not never mind these things happen we were given information about what was happening and staff were doing their best fast nottrack security was fast made my way to the lounge in south terminal which was busy but i was able to find a quiet spot lots of food and drinks on offer but i stuck to water as i knew  be eating on the plane had to go to a gate in b terminal  not this was my first time at terminal 5 so asked how to  to the gate very easy instructions given and transportation via the transit train boarding was easy although i did not use the priority boarding service my british-airwaysd missing the announcement i paid extra so i could pre notbook my seat 63j on the upper deck and really glad i did our cabin crew were wonderful so attentive and polite and nothing seemed any bother for them the food was good for airplane food and the pink champagne was very nice i managed to  a couple of hours sleep which is very unusual for me there's lots of room and the upper deck is limited to a maximum of 20 passengers so it feels very private the window seats have lots of storage but unless you are in 62 or 64 a/k you have to climb over your neighbour's foot stool/legs to  in and out of your seat 63j is an aisle seat so less private but lots of room as it's by an exit door ideal for anybody over 6ft there is a long not too high drawer to place items i put a pair of knee notlength leather boots in there without any issue and there was room for more and there's the overhead lockers i could not fault my trip out and i am hoping my return trip is just as enjoyable
" london heathrow to mumbritish-airwaysi i've been a loyal ba customer for several years but this was a journey of disappointment i was late to the airport due to delays on the train line called customer services while on my way and after 15min of wait i was told they could not do anything about it but gave me the number of the airport it was incorrect at terminal 5 i asked the attendant for help given the rush he was quite rude and said i had to join the queue unless i was flying business at the gate we had a late boarding because 'the computer was not working' i was flying premium economy and let me say on this flight ba0199 it is like the economy class of several other airlines  plus this 777 was in desperate need of a refurbishment my headrest was hanging down the seat the screen was filthy and its arm broken so it  not stay in position the flight attendant who i never saw smiling for the entire flight said he had reported it on the way in i asked to change my seat in my new seat the headph audio had regular loud cracks and pops it was not the headphs i tried mine too the entertainment system was poor it started nearly an hour into the flight and stopped an hour before landing plus the 'noise cancelling' headphs are not noise cancelling  not try pulling the jack out and it does not make a difference overall a very poor experience crowned by a terrible breakfast sorry ba but you are stuck in the 80s and you're slipping further down my list of preferences

 san jose costa rica to london gatwick we were firstly unable to  two seats toher at online check notin the next day at the airport we asked the clerk if we could have our seats toher and he refused i argued my case that we had paid a lot of my for these flights after about ten minutes he showed the seating plan to his supervisor who immediately approved changing us to be seated toher i later found out the two ba employees travelling either for free or at a drastically reduced rate had been given the seats originally and were eventually after a great deal of argument moved i have complained to ba and they have confirmed that this did indeed happen and will ensure it does not in the future next up we both had salmon and were both ill towards the end of the flight my ife didnt work they offered to move me ironically to swap with  of the ba employees but i declined as it defeated the object of wanting to sit with my wife choice of starter also not available but that was no big deal dreadful stressful experience for people who'd paid a lot of my have been called by customer service who have offered us 10000 avios as compensation enough for a night at the holiday inn express awful company to deal with totally dismissive of customer need on the plus side business class seats were comfortable and cabin crew attentive ba need to do better though far better if they are to compete with the good middle east and far eastern airlines
 amman to london heathrow staff were very minimalistic in their service they were not rude but not willing to be helpful or go out of their way to make a good impression  i fly very often not often with ba so thought i'd try it and now realized they do not compare with other major airlines
 london heathrow to miami i paid £50 extra for an exit seat  not this is the best thing to do make sure you  the  closest to window mainly because no not stands there to stretch their legs etc you  unlimited leg room and the ability to stand up and wander / stretch whenever you want and it is good value on a ten hour flight the seats on the a380 are narrow the entertainment system the usual etc the meals were fine my major issue with british-airways economy is their penny pinching you sit down there is no welcome snack  not you then have your meal and  seven hours later if you are hungry you have to pay for british-airwayssic snacks it's ridiculous on american airlines they put out boxes of pretzels biscuits etc which you can just help yourself to if you have a diet coke on american you  a full 330ml can on british-airways you  the small version there are so few differences flying in economy between different airlines these things count ba has no other major advantages so sadly why use them
 lisbon to london heathrow now that ba have started charging for all food and drink on short haul flights they might as well rebrand to a bud airline over the last few years leg room across european flights business and economy class has decreased to the point where it now practically the same as any bud airline that said it is in practice worse than bud airlines because at least the main bud carriers have d the decent thing of removing the seat recline button eliminating further discomfort even without the seat in front reclined any taller than 5' 8 will be packed in tightly on any european short nothaul flight the staff are friendly and polite however they are often struggling to pass through the whole economy cabin with drinks/food sales service especially when the plane is full and the flight is under 2hours 30mins this does not only result in thirsty / hungry customers but also the almost permanent presence of the service trolleys in the aisle blocking access to the toilets business class which i sometimes use is offered a free meal and drinks all of a reasonable quality however in terms of legroom / seat size there is no benefit compared to economy the only reason i continue to fly ba is because i have fairly set routes and ba generally fly at times which suit me otherwise i  little in the way of added value the benefits of avios points and moving up membership tiers are hardly worth it in mtary terms particularly if  mostly flies within europe it is much cheaper to  a lounge membership many are valid for most european  not and beyond  not airports rather than remain loyal to ba these days i have been flying with ba for well over a decade now on a monthly british-airwayssis my sympathies go to the staff because i fear cost notcutting will  them next which will no doubt be to the detriment of the high standards the crews maintain to this day
 berlin tegel to london heathrow i decided to give british-airways a chance for a short weekend trip to london because when it comes to prices they cannot beat the low notcost airlines and what do you know i had a part of the low notcost experience paying a bigger price: no checked notin luggage included not even as a world emerald and you had to pay for your inflight snacks and beverages a plus is that the prices for the snacks and drinks were not as high as with other airlines that have introduced this service lately and the quality was good the prices were even below airport s the british-airwaysd thing was indeed that they needed a lot of time to deliver all the products people were buying stuff and it took ages until you could  your order  not well you ca not compete with ryanair trying to do better the things they do best i really miss the days when british-airways was offering tea nad coffee for free and a little snack it was a pleasure to fly with them and i  be happy to  british-airwaysck to those days some good things about the flights was that they landed ahead of schedule boarding was very efficient which is a big plus and the seats were gorgeous a lot of space very comfortable leather seats as an advice please do not try to be some else stay where british-airways used to be and the success will come losing an identity can cause more financial damage then a sandwich and a tea offered for free
 istanbul to london heathrow i am a frequent flyer between turkey and canada i got first time flight by british-airways i feel it was the worst airline so far compared to others can you imagine that they even did not give a cup of water to the passengers for 35 nothour flight from istanbul to london  they explained it by economical concerns what is the economical benefit not to serve a cup of water also from london to vancouver we delayed almost 2 hours because of luggage issues and a passenger did not feel well and he had to leave the plane which could be understandable this part but the plane was old boeing 747 the screens were very british-airwaysd quality and small the name of the company is big but quality of the service is far below than average cabin crew are professional though so this is not their mistake it was enough trouble for me not to select ba in my flights in the future
" filthy dirty tired boeing 777 not200 to chicago british-airways first class seat is british-airwaysrely a business class seat on other airlines food absolutely terrible and service from crew hurried and disinterested ife movies limited selection and slow this is an airline in decline they do not care because of limited competition across the atlantic in summary not first class but rather no class finally their first class lounge at heathrow was dirty and worn

 london heathrow to bangkok as you walk into heathrow t5 you have the feeling of a world class airline  not and that's where it stopped 20 minutes late for boarding then only after they had got every on the plane did they say sorry we have technical problems and passenger didnt turn up  not it took them 1 hour to fix the plane did not tell us what the problem was and remove the passengers british-airwaysgs i gave up my seat 38d for a lady wanting to sit with her friends so i got 40d  not big mistake seat does not recline and the headrest extender was broken and kept slipping down upon takeoff the aircon above decided it was going to start leaking water above  not when the guy sat in seat enquired the staff smiled said she  see what she can do then went to the galley behind me and i heard her say to a co notworker that's the last of her problems it was the coldest plane i have been on their was people on the plane wearing winter jackets i was that cold i took the blanket put it over my head and wrapped round behind my elbows and pulled it down with my feet toilet behind me was continually sucking the whole flight they had to manually reset every's screens they were very old the fact my mobile has a bigger screen leaves a lot to be desired not to mention whatever you tried to watch  have continual lag the interior on the seating was old and lumpy i'm sitting here writing this 8 hours later and my british-airwaysckside is still raw they do not even have usb's to charge your ph  so they encourage you to use their mobile app for digital boarding pass to make it more seamless then fail to put any usb charge points around the plane going to email ba and ask for a refund on my return ticket as i can hstly say out of the 20 or so airlines i have flown on over the years this is by far the worst 
 gatwick to cape town this journey was a very pleasant surprise i did not expect great service and was not disappointed i did not expect great food or wine and was not disappointed i did not expect a comfortable economy seat and was pleasantly surprised this was an older 777 with a 3 not3 not3 configuration 31 seat pitch in economy and comfortable seats i flew to south africa this time last year with virgin on their new b787 and it was a nightmare the comfort of seat on a long haul is far more important to me that anything else and this was a far more pleasant experience than i had expected
 toronto to london in premium economy easy check in and fast track security meant i was in the lounge within 15 mins unfortunately they were clearing up and restocking from the earlier flight poor choice of stale sandwiches and soup on it's last legs i let the front desk know and the staff made me a fresh sandwich also beers had changed with 5 lagers and newcastle brown the manager fetched some ipa from the first lounge  not some really good customer service which is typical in this lounge the most disorganised boarding ever with few pas onboard juice or water offered i asked for sparking wine but it's only d on flights from london  not crew explained it ca not be chilled at outstations  not poor excuse given they do it for club and first fast service after take off with an ok entree poor salad and a nasty dry piece of cake ife was the same as my trip over christmas so it seems the ife is updated less often tea coffee and juice offered before landing but no muffin or even a biscuit  not really poor prompt disembritish-airwaysrking and british-airwaysgs beat me to the british-airwaysggage belt return a week later was a better flight easy check in again and no fast track queue north lounge was an average experience ok choice of sandwiches but not particularly clean and in need of a refresh bused to aircraft a boeing 787 not9 with premium economy only half full a half glass of prosecco was offered and a requested top up was forgotten fast british-airwaysr service by excellent cabin crew who offered good customer service an ok meal with a rancid coleslaw ok steak and a tiny pot of desert generous with the drinks unfortunately the dropping of afternoon tea at the british-airwaysck is inexplicable and really poor judgement by ba i was offered t&cs plus a breakfast british-airwaysr or malt loaf finger the crew were genuinely embritish-airwaysrrassed a couple of sandwiches i liberated from the club lounge made up for it fast off the plane and despite slow immigration the british-airwaysgs beat me again overall the flight was ok but certainly not up to the standard of premium economy on competitors the meal is nowhere near club standard and its the cutting of the small things  not nibbles breakfast and afternoon tea which irk me the most be competitive but do not take it out on me i  not mind but the prices do not go down with the reduction of service despite what the ceo maintains  not it is not in response to customer feedbritish-airwaysck ba need to listen to what we're saying and take a long hard look at their conscious decision to downgrade service and become as british-airwaysd as the bud airlines eventually the hardiest of us loyal ba customers will give up and move airline / alliance and that  be a shame
 london heathrow to stuttgart fly in comfort and style is the slogan of british-airways but there is not much of either around these days not willing to pay an extra £8 i was allocated a middle seat right at the rear at the gate an announcement was made for volunteers to check in their hand notluggage at no extra cost within a minute a burly employee told me i had to check in my cabin british-airwaysg saying you should not believe what is said on the company's website how very true some ten other passengers equally perplexed suffered the same fate i know there were ten because another employee kept counting us and saying we need ten the burly employee was later to be found on the airbridge to make sure that we really did hand over our cabin british-airwaysgs all in all a demeaning experience the seat rows are now more tightly packed than before although of average slim build i found the seat a tight fit only a few passengers took up the offer to purchase food or drink the deceptive upgrade we were sold at the beginning of the year but still did not reach the british-airwaysck of the plane until shortly before landing not only have the complimentary food and drink disappeared but also newspapers and priority boarding for those of us who are frequent flyers on the return journey i noticed part of the reason for this new policy: the stuttgart ground staff have now been replaced by agency staff ba is now no better than the no frills competitors but keeps the facade of a full service airline with full service prices a loyal customer of many many years i will choose their competitors in future
 london heathrow to las vegas and a great journey the flight was on time and staff were professional and friendly the inflight meals were tasty and the portions of a good size although the seats are a bit narrow they were comfortable and the leg room was adequate facilities on the plane were clean would definitely fly ba again
 london heathrow to rome return race to the bottom my first time with the new buy onboard service i was not happy when they announced this and this flight confirmed my disappointment basically it does not work i can understand in some ways why they decided to offer a wide range of food options i  have accepted this if they had kept the free drinks even soft drinks are chargeable  not i do not think this is acceptable however despite the extensive menu there was an extremely limited selection available one crew member came round soon after the flight took off and took orders for hot food there was a 20 not25 minute wait time for this the crew then came around with the drinks trolley this was extremely slow the payments could only be made with credit cards or avios points the payment added significant times to process despite sitting 3 rows from the front of the cabin we did not  our drinks until 30 minutes after they started there was only the  trolley and they were still serving the rear of the cabin as we were starting our decent ceo alex cruz and british-airways  not your airline used to distinguish itself from the competition but you are on a race to the bottom  not more rows in economy 10 abreast in some 777's and other cost cutting measures mean that even though i'm a silver exec club member i am now considering my future travel options i live near manchester airport and klm/air france and lufthansa are more attractive options
 edinburgh to london city despite having a confirmed booking when i attempted to check notin with a prepaid notfor british-airwaysg at 1535 at the edi airport for a 1655 flight to lcy domestic flight i was told i couldnt as the flight had been oversold i accepted an offer to switch to a later flight on the same route with flybe and take compensation but then was told the compensation couldnt be authorised so i had to ‘wait i then stood around for 10 minutes being asked to ‘move out of the way at  point because i was blocking others i was not given a copy of the compensation scheme details despite what the ba website claims should be d and the staff seemed unclear of it themselves i was simply ignored until i approached the desk again and insisted to speak to a supervisor n was available nor could be contacted apparently i wasnt allowed to transfer to the flybe flight “in case” a seat became available on my original flight so they tagged my luggage but did not check it in i was told to wait for another 20 minutes i argued this was not fair to leave me in limbo given i had a confirmed booking in the first place but i was british-airwayssically ignored and informed this flight is regularly oversold and its not their problem that other people had checked notin before me i was treated as a nuisance at  point there were 5 members of ba check in staff doing nothing nobody else to serve whilst i was just standing silently there ‘waiting and being ignored after 20 minutes of not knowing what to do my original flight closed and i was approached by a supervisor who suddenly was available to talk to me and given a seat i asked how it was that a seat has magically appeared if earlier i had been told the flight was already full with no seats available he explained that the seats had been prepaid for by others who had then not checked in and as the check notin was closing they could give me the seat now i informed him that i resented having been treated rudely by his staff earlier though the supervisor himself was professional and courteous and that his staff are untrained to deal with overbookings i had d nothing wrong to deserve being treated so shabbily like a problem rather than a customer i then had a predictably stressful rush through security to ensure i was not denied boarding at the gate for being late even though i had arrived at the airport with plenty of time to spare originally especially for a domestic flight as i told the supervisor if the airline treats its customers with such contempt do not be surprised that the public ends up viewing the airline with contempt under their current policy of overbooking passengers who do not pay more to reserve a seat in advance are at risk of not ting a seat at all even though they have a confirmed booking some  call this cheating the saving grace of the experience was that the flight was punctual and unlike mainline ba this route is run by its subsidiary ba cityflyer which still offers complimentary drinks and a snack for which the cabin crew service was efficient i rate it 2 out of 10 for the stress incurred in checking in
 accra to london heathrow on ba is a 6 hr 50 min overnight flight sleeping on overnight flights in economy class is an ordeal in itself bit i was highly disappointed that more than an hour before landing  not we had just entered french airspace  not all cabin lights were put on bright for the breakfast/snack service following the dinner after take notof in accra: the more since this service consisted of a cup of tea or coffee or cold drink only not even a biscuit was offered i was shocked
 this a tale of two airlines and their individual approaches to business class passengers we were flying to mauritius on holiday and i felt given the flying time we should spoil ourselves and fly up notfront with all the 'comparative' comfort of business class the british-airways flight itself was okay the crew friendly and the cabin worked fine however i was totally shocked by the standards of catering in the gatwick lounge a small issue for some perhaps but for me it's all part of the business class experience to illustrate my point i attach a shot of what walsh's policy of putting shareholders first actually means for fare notpaying passengers with the very confusing layout that greets  in the south terminal now that ba have moved in the 'serve yourself' check notin you even label your own british-airwaysgs i was pretty frustrated by the time we actually found the 'lounge' but then to be greeted with this was totally unacceptable so willie rather than screwing down costs for the benefit of your shareholders this sort of display of overt cost notcutting has now lost you revenue for the future short notsighted management or what take a lesson from emirates who i decided to fly home with so disgusted was i over our experience they put passengers first
 london heathrow to vancouver returnboth flights were punctual but sadly the 747 not400 aircraft used are now beginning to look their 20 plus years of age especially compared to the a380s ba have used on this route the cabin is looking rather tired and worn and the seats are not comfortable enough for a 9 hour flight i was very pleased to have booked an exit row seat for additional room the ife system is also quite dated and limited compared to modern offerings on the plus side the cabin staff were friendly helpful and courteous and this is somewhere ba seem to do well food and drink were complimentary and of decent quality for economy class boarding at yvr was very well organised less so at the heathrow end it is also a shame that these flights depart from the cramped terminal 3 at heathrow overall a reasonable experience but  that they could improve to excellent with a bit more polish
 return trip from washington dulles to london heathrow flight was british-airwaysrely a quarter full going to washington flight was probritish-airwaysbly only about a third full attendants said it was the quietest they had every seen given that i was on an a380 it really did look empty food and service was good both ways and the aircraft was only a couple of years old plenty of room on the downstairs cabin and the overhead lockers seemed larger than any other airliner i'd flown on i was given an exit row seat which was very welcome ba usually charge £58 for this seat it meant about 5 foot of legroom and because the next cabin in front was business class the toilets were curtained off for the entire flight meaning the area was very quiet no real gripes although the snack served about an hour before landing has been downgraded from a small meal to a tiny twix chocolate and a cup of coffee flight cost £430 and using some airmiles i knocked this down to £330 loads of interactive channels to watch but films were not the best but that's a personal thing
bangkok to london with british-airways i'm a frequent flyer for a change we decided to fly ba to london from thailand for our 12 hour journey when we were seated we realized that the seat cushion was coming away underneath there were lots of litter we then realized that we ca not watch movies etc due to fact that there was no sound i informed the cabin crew and they said that they will report to relevant people etc our other complaint was the food  not it had no taste whatsoever and was served with plastic cutlery which broke few times in short i  not recommend flying with ba
london to hong kong with british-airways the flight is good as i booked the best business seat and it is imperative if flying ba to  this best seat 16k other seats are below standard for long haul business yet a similar seat on an a380 is better service is good and food is adequate i fly this route many times on ba rather than cx: cx is better but ba better priced and that is if you  the best seat 7 points for b777 and 8 for a380
flying british-airways from paris to london is less convenient as they are the only major airline that has the check in counter located  floor down at british-airwayssement but good that on this occasion the business class lounge is relocated to the cathay pacific lounge as this caters for long haul passengers boarding on time but held in tarmac for half an hour not ba's fault the pilot tried to make up time but still failed by a few minutes to have lost the allotted time so the aircraft parked a mile away with inconvenient stair deplane and coach connection but good that business passengers are taken away first in a separate car the flight is ok with snack and drink
 chicago to london heathrow do not waste your my buying ba seat assignments in advance i did that a month ago at the same time as i made my booking and paid for an aisle seat of my choice when i went british-airwaysck  week before my journey my aisle seat was g and i was placed in an undesirable middle seat there was no remedy for this five calls over three days to ba connected me to people in delhi whose only vocabulary was unfortunately sorry and just no i have been deceived lied to and put off i have flown british many times; this is absolutely my last time it is acceptable to make an error but totally unacceptable to callously make no effort at all to rectify it take my advice choose another airline i am a oneworld emerald flyer on aa flew 200k miles last year and i can tell good service from british-airwaysd british-airways has unfortunately declined british-airwaysdly
 the quality of british-airways has most certainly g downhill on short haul from london heathrow to rome it is nothing more than that of easyjet online check in was quick and easy and terminal 5 is a delight however online check in is only available 24 hours before departure unlike easyjet which allows for check in 30 days prior to departure that was the only good part of our journey we boarded a packed old 767 which was decaying with the middle seat e so narrow it was impossible to  in and out of the seat in flight we were in row 13 without notice we had to go through de noticing which meant a 45min delay to our service we did however catch up 35mins our inbound flight was on a newer a319 which had better seats and a skymap due to slot restrictions at rome and london this flight was also delayed during both flights the new buy on board was poorly d taking forever with a limited range of overpriced products i therefore can only conclude that the airline that once  just 10 months ago offering meals on short haul flights as well as always being on time is now nothing more than a low cost carrier with older planes and a useless service what a shame
 london heathrow to brussels living in england for 6 months i décided to go british-airwaysck home for a week i am terrifying about flying but choose to do it by plane anyway i am happy to have chosen ba in the airport at the gate in the plane i felt safe and people listen to me i had the chance the two times going and british-airwaysck to meet the captain in the cockpit to feel better the crew was nice and friendly and thanks to them i had a comfortable flight and i am now ready to take it again the planes were clean and nice
my partner and i flew dublin to seattle via london heathrow with british-airways heathrow to seattle was on a b777 not200 which was slightly dated and seats were rather cramped making it impossible to sleep on a 9 not10hr flight online check notin was not possible and we were not able to select our seats as our booking had an iberia flight number even though it was operated by ba made lengthy ph calls and same response was given that nothing could be d about it until the airport arrived early at airport to find plane was overbooked so my partner and i did not  our seats toher  not ground staff could do nothing about it luckily we were able to swap with another passenger once on board food was bland to say the least  not possibly the worse on any carrier i've ever flown with however service provided by cabin crew was excellent would only fly ba again for this
 the whole experience was poor flying from london heathrow to athens ancient aircraft 767 poor inflight entertainment and the new food offering in which you purchase your food was very slow and lacking some of the very limited range of products on short haul and athens at 4 hours is classified as this ba is now a low cost carrier without the efficiency of the more established low cost carriers the sole advantage is that they fly to/from major airports this airline is trading on past reputation and it can only be a matter of time until a largely loyal customer british-airwaysse deserts them for alternative airlines
 doha to london heathrow having flown into doha with qatar airways the flight with british-airways was a shock for a start the club world seats are not comfortable there is hardly anywhere to stow bits and pieces the cabin crew were indifferent we departed at approximately 9am immediately on reaching cruising altitude we were informed that they were now serving lunch at 10am we were told that we  be given sandwiches on descent this on a 7 hour flight a cynical person might think that the crew wanted to  meal service out of the way early i do not know what timez lunch was in possibly bangkok but certainly not doha or london time after 5 hours i rang the bell the female cabin crew person came and asked incredulously did you ring the bell yes once the entire flight i asked for the sandwich and she told me that i  have to wait no i want it now not a five course meal a sandwich having just flown on qatar airways where the entire menu is a la carte and you can order anything at any time apparently a pre notprepared sandwich was a big ask in business class i was then pointedly ignored for the rest of the flight i did complain immediately to ba and to their credit i received a response  not british-airwayssically they were sorry i felt this way never again pay a fortune for this british-airwayssic service
" will never touch british-airways again having flown ba on this route from orlando to london heathrow for a long time their services have seriosuly g downhill when i went to the british-airwaysck of the plane to ask for a snack i was told i had to buy them having paid over £1000 for my tickets i replied i'm not doing that i've paid enough for this flight already to which the cabin manager replied 'well thats just the way the industry is going people want value for my and this is how you  it all the airlines are doing it if you do not like it tough' i have never been spoken to so rudely by a member of staff in my life as well as this the seats were old and the screens did not work other airlines namely air new zealand singapore airlines even american in my opinion now represent a lot better value for my you even still  snacks on long haul flights i guess all the airlines are doing it right

 leeds bradford to heathrow service is equal to ryanair and easyjet i've been flying with ba regularly for last 4 years and i ca not  my head around what is going on complimentary drinks replaced with a buy on board menu and the flight is so short not all passengers even  served now  really just appalling there is no competition on the lba route but i certainly wo not pay anything extra to travel with ba from now on if there are alternatives available  not ryanair it is at around a fifth of the price usually
 vienna to los angeles via london on 12/31/16 at 5pm the night before my flight i received an email saying that my first leg to london had been cancelled and i needed to call to reschedule on the ph the rep told me that he had a flight out later in the day i could take on the 31st i said great book that he did and i received the conformation and noticed that the flight was scheduled for 1/31/17 i told him and he said oh yes that was an error on our part however to book this he gave up my other seat i told him this was his mistake and he needed to fix it he said the only thing he could do was give me a partial refund which  be useless as it was $2k to buy a new ticket or i could fly out on 1/4/17 i asked if british-airways  comp my hotel for their mistake he said no and i asked how he expected me to pay for a hotel for 4 more nights he had no answer he refused to book me on any other airline i asked for a manager he said there were n available i fought with ba from 5pm until 1am no exaggeration i have screeenshots of the ph calls i decided to  up at 6am go to the airport and talk with a ba rep  not only to find out they have no ba reps but a rep representing a ba rep she told me at first she could do nothing either and i told her i did not care where in the us she got me just  me to the us she managed to  me a flight to philadelphia the next day she comp'd my hotel for the night and all meals as a business who has inconvenienced me should however she failed to tell me that my flights were not connected and i had to individually check in to each  the check notin associate also failed to do so therefore when the stewardess for airberlin was 30 minutes late and made us delayed quite a bit i had to run to the next gate only to find out i was not checked in so they gave my seat away i begged and pleaded and cried and they somehow by the grace of a higher being found a seat upon arrival into the us i was so grateful until i found out my british-airwaysg was left in dusseldorf it took another 2 weeks to  it british-airwaysck at the end of it ba left me in a $400 deficit had to  home to ca from philly  i contacted customer service to complain and it took over a month to hear british-airwaysck and all they had to say was that they could not do anything for me next time i will spend however much more it costs to fly with an airline who has some form of management overseeing their employees and i know will not screw me over lufthansa for example treated me so well and i was not even a paying customer
❎ unverified |  london heathrow to innsbruck i have been a loyal customer of british-airways for 30 years if ever i had a choice between them and another airline i chose british-airways but no more the new food and drink service is appalling the crew on our flight never made it to the last 8 or so rows so my children sat at the british-airwaysck went thirsty this was particularly poor as another child had wandered to the british-airwaysck of the plane and vomited copiously everywhere  not clearly that is not ba's fault but it is their fault that i could not then  a drink for my children to take their minds off the stench of puke pervading our part of the plane next time i will fly ryanair i doubt we'll notice any difference
 los angeles to london heathrow starting with being charged $180 to check my hold luggage despite on the outbound sectors being able to check in hold luggage for free the onboard service continues to decline for passengers in ba world traveller  not terrible food minimal drinks and raised eye brows if you ask for a second glass of wine you  the feeling that if you so much as ask for anything other than the british-airwaysre minimum you will be restrained and arrested on arrival at your destination seat was okay  better comfort than american airlines i have to say but the movie selection and tv selection was poor as usual with random selections of tv programmes which are interrupted continually by onboard announcements the new ba ceo is doing a great job of turning a once great airline into their low cost subsidiary vueling
 gatwick to barcelona unimpressed with the new m&s on board service boarding process british-airwaysdly organised and the cabin crew cabin british-airwaysgs quite a few were in the overhead compartment and it took ages for all the passengers to place their british-airwaysgs overhead i had to put my british-airwaysg much behind my row it's not point to fly with them anymore as their service is just like bud airlines but sadly i booked my tickets before the announcement of buy onboard
 london heathrow to rio de janeiro 45 minute delay on the tarmac air conditioning was not working during delay  not  only work once engines were on the cabin was therefore unbearably hot the foam in my seat 30b had deteriorated to the point i could feel the metal british-airwaysr underneath digging into my tail b i informed the cabin staff of this  not but due to the flight being overbooked i could not be moved and so i was given an extra pillow this is a 12 hour flight and i do not think this is acceptable i was very uncomfortable during this flight in flight entertainment kept pausing and pixelating/blipping in flight snacks now have to be paid for considering the price of flights i think this is very poor british-airways is not a bud airline in fact airlines currently rated lower than ba in the top 100 airlines eg virgin atlantic and malaysian airlines still provide complimentary on board snacks there were two in flight meals on this flight  not on both occasions i was not offered the meal of my choice as it had run out once i could forgive  not but twice when i complained about this to the flight staff on the second occasion keep in mind this was at the end of the flight when i had been sitting on an uncomfortable metal british-airwaysr for 10 hours  not the steward informed me that 'i was travelling to a poor country and i should be grateful for the food i was ting' how rude i do not book flights with ba to  lectured by your flight staff the quality of the meals have dropped dramatically no crackers or cheese no fruit what is now served with the mail meal is coleslaw and fruitcake both of which i intensely dislike this is what made the unavailability of complimentary snacks on the flight even more upsetting i'd had no choice in your menu and what was served up was unpalatable i have to take medication that needs to be taken with food  not i had no choice but to purchase food on board an additional charge on an already expensive flight is a 'hard pill to swallow'

 london heathrow to berlin tegel a good flight food is good for a short nothaul flight in business class but i note that there is no longer free snack and drink in economy now they sell m&s stuff but the question is whether it is worth the while flying business short nothaul i did only because it is  of my long haul segments i expect nothing and it turn out to exceed my expectation 
❎ unverified |  gatwick to salzburg return in business class and these were pleasant flights with both flights arriving early the flight out was early morning so a hot breakfast was provided with champagne on the flight british-airwaysck afternoon tea was provided rather than lunch which was odd for a flight leaving at 1400 local time

❎ unverified |  bordeaux to london gatwick as a former executive gold card holder 7 years running my long haul travels had stopped due to change of job so sadly lost my status british-airwaysck to blue i have just started flying again with british-airways and just recently the bordeaux to gatwick route once served by a 737 not400 and now replaced by the more modern a320 to my surprise the cabin looks very nice although the leg room seems to have reduced to that of ryanair and has a pleasant feeling sadly discovered  has to pay for wine and food on board now economy but the wines are not good i am a wine trade professional if the food is m&s concept why do not they  m&s to supply them the wines too years ago the selection process at british-airways was different and the wines were then great but overall my flight to gatwick was enjoyable the crew professional and hardly more expensive than easyjet on the same route my next ba trip is on february 18th this time to shanghai i am concerned though to read the generally appalling comments about ba's long haul routes by various travellers and worry about what to expect now on my forthcoming flight in economy i hope ba is taking these comments onboard seriously
❎ unverified |  london heathrow to san francisco return upgraded from premium economy to business on outward leg and business as booked on return both legs on the a380 which is a super plane spacious comfortable and clean entertainment screens are so much bigger than those on the older 747's both flights were very good with attentive friendly cabin crew and excellent food my only complaint was that the inbound flight was 7 minutes past scheduled time and this was sufficient for me to miss my connecting flight ba should never book connections with such a tight schedule problem was compounded by disinterested ground staff especially a ba manager at t5 who was more interested in continuing a conversation with colleagues than assisting a passenger who was helping to pay his wages
 aberdeen to paris via london heathrow british-airways has stooped to its lowest level of penury by introducing a well notmarketed and poorly executed scheme of m& s tie notup on catering in european and domestic routes ba is where a passenger has to remain thirsty for even a 3 hr flight to far europe destination without a credit or debit card leave al any complimentary drink even a cup of water is charged no cash accepted stooped to lowest levels of customer service from being a renowned airline i will evaluate all other options before travelling ba in domestic and european routes although i am a bronze member 
 london heathrow to copenhagen my first time experiencing british-airways buy noton notboard service this must be brand suicide at its worst how ba can go from a full notservice carrier to low cost overnight is astounding the brand is now cheapened the offering before was not gourmet but at least you could pass the time with a tea and biscuit now you ca not even  hot water for free even sas offer a complimentary coffee what ceases to amaze me is more and more is taken away by british-airways in every single class you travel yet you do not see a decrease in ticket prices the positives to this flight were that it was on time and the crew were friendly  but i do feel it must be a complete embritish-airwaysrrassment for them
 london heathrow to washington dulles my first long haul flight with british-airways flight on time quite new and spotless aircraft very friendly and efficient cabin crew descent lunch followed by the snack served 1 hour prior to landing good choice of drinks and soft drinks informative cockpit crew wide choice of ife cons: limited legroom in economy additionally limited by the electronix box beneath the seat overall i am impressed decent value for the my paid i  definitely fly with ba again
 heathrow to hong kong in business class on 3rd january as part of a holiday to new zealand also involving flights with cathay pacific and malaysia airlines the flight to hong kong with british-airways showed up all that is british-airwaysd about british-airways now and how far it has fallen behind other airlines the continual penny pinching and poor staff attitude was evident throughout the flight check notin at terminal 5 was chaotic there having been a computer glitch which greatly slowed the check notin and british-airwaysg drop processes there were too few ba staff on hand to assist and those that were in evidence were being continually harassed business check notin was better but still very busy ba needs to speed up british-airwaysg drop urgently other airports allow you to print your own british-airwaysggage labels and take your british-airwaysggage straight to be loaded onto the conveyor belt where a member of staff checks the weight to make sure it is not too heavy not perfect for all passengers but  considerably speed up the process for the vast majority of passengers who can check in easily the lounge was a disappointment with tired dirty furniture used dishes not being cleared too few seats for the number of passengers and very poor food availability not a great place to rest before an 11 hour journey and i  concur with other comments about the deteriorating standards compare this to the other home lounges of other carriers such as those at hong kong and kuala lumpur took a shower whilst waiting and that was ok the flight was not good at all cabin crew showed general lack of interest throughout the flight and seemed interested in just ting the meals served and then disappearing from view for the rest of the flight until it was time for the meal service prior to landing g are all the small and not so small touches that made flying with ba a pleasure such as hanging up coats hot towels a second round of drinks a nice meal at a leisurely pace and an overall feeling of being well looked after a comment about the seats how can ba justify 8 across in business class when the ying/yang seats were first introduced they were a revolution but a lot of other airlines now only have 6 across with a lot more space and comfort and in most cases you do not have to climb over another person to  out whilst they are sleeping i had a window seat and i felt very hemmed in there was no storage space for the things you need during a flight glasses tablet computer water bottle etc all were kept on the floor or crammed down the side of the seat sadly ba is no longer my airline of choice i spent many years doing international business travel and when you saw the union flag on the tailfin at some distant airport you knew you were already nearly home i saved a considerable number of avios points for my retirement which i am now using up but on other airlines within the one world alliance where possible and who offer a far better product and actually look after their passengers and make them feel wanted sorry ba but you've lost my loyalty club world is now very poor and also club europe now and you've lost the plot to the bean counters never thought i'd say this but i've joined the abba club anybody but ba

 flew from los angeles to nice via london heathrow 2 words: travel nightmare every leg of my british-airways flight was delayed including  which was delayed due to a paperwork issue that  take 10 minutes 2 hours later we took off late inbound flights caused me to miss my connection which british-airways charged me exorbitant fees and wait in a 4 hour line to rebook inflight entertainment audio system did not work properly which was not resolved and offered no compensation as a result by far the worst travel my wife or i have ever experienced we will be avoiding this airline for life
 zurich to london heathrow and my first trip on ba since they scrapped any type of complimentary service onboard for us lowly economy cabin travellers this is now some weeks on since they introduced their buy onboard snack options but cabin staff acted like it was their first day and that they had no training okay it might not be easy for them but they all appeared very british-airwaysd tempered with customer questions about the new ryanair style service and a lot of tutting as they served those who decided to buy something i am sick and tired of the ceo of ba telling us everywhere this is what their customers asked for be hst and accept that this is a ploy to enhance your personal bonus at the end of year and keep shareholders happy that said it seems the ba reputation is on the slide across many markets and that's where shareholders should be truly worried and no i sold my ba shares many years ago
 gatwick to barcelona return and just dreadful pretty much sums up this british-airways business class experience since ba moved to gatwick south terminal their new lounge is still not ready they're currently using the clubrooms and the old virgin atlantic lounge now called the speedbird lounge gold card holders and passengers travelling in business or first class use the clubrooms what a sorry state this lounge was full with limited seating a forty minute wait for food no available snacks and empty drinks cabinets i left as hungry and thirsty as i arrived no to worry though british-airways will feed me onboard once onboard for a two hour flight i was served afternoon tea which consisted of three finger sandwiches a sc and a really small slice of cake this meal was completely insufficient there was  drinks round offered and  top up offered given that ba use the smallest glasses possible coupled with its love of miniature cans of lemonade you will be thirsty i found trading up to business class to be completely not worth the extra spend after being disappointed by the outbound catering my disappointment was set to continue with the exact same afternoon tea meal served on my inbound flight staff were indifferent and spent most of their time chatting in galley
 sofia to london heathrow the flight was on time but british-airways has slipped to low bud airline standards  i've been using ba for many years but my next holiday is booked on another airline i cannot score more than 1 even for cabin crew as i did not receive any service onboard almost 3 hour flight and not  question or moment of attention from the cabin crew you receive attention only if you ask to buy something from them  not food water etc crew is not guilty they are victims of the new airline policies ba just lost it's class

 vancouver to london heathrow and i was really really hoping that british-airways had refurbished the interior of the boeing 747 i was flying on sadly this was not the case the seats were uncomfortable and the video screens were about half the size of an ipad and definitely looked as if they were 20 years old the service was great and flight attendants  pass by regularly with refreshments
 london heathrow to milan return how british-airways have fallen in their service and product  not they are no better than ryanair now and frankly unless lhr is convenient to you i  seek another airline not even a drink offered unless you pay although another passenger stated water was free but it was not offered seats the same as any else and they insist on putting these silly yellow cabin british-airwaysg british-airwaysnds on carry on british-airwaysgs like they mean anything i checked a british-airwaysg so just had a small carry on but the staff insisted it have this silly thing attached that i immediately ripped off the only benefit was my frequent flier tier meant i got early boarding this is my last trip through lhr as the connection procedure is so awful american airlines are now better than british-airways and that says it all

 how the mighty have fallen or should i say continue to fall my partner and i booked tickets from london to johannesburg british-airwaysck in september 16 we paid approx £1700 for the 2 economy tickets slightly more than normal as we paid for extra leg room seats it was an evening flight and we were traveling on the relatively new a380 our first problem was that our there was not enough room for our hand luggage near to our seats so it was placed some 30 feet further down the aircraft  not not life threatening just annoying when you want to  things out of the british-airwaysg we were surprised about the lack of space our real issue was that when it came to serving our evening meal that the flight attendant announced here is your veable lasagne rather than explaining that for our £1700 they were not able to offer us the default evening meal chicken or beef as they had ran out of these they made no effort to remedy the situation whether there were other choices in premium or business we will never know all i can say is that i am pretty easy to please when it comes to food but was not happy with a veable lasagne so i had no meal as a result as i left the aircraft i received a text from ba asking for feedbritish-airwaysck on the flight i took the time to respond  explaining all the above but received no response whilst i was in johannesburg i tried to contact/ call johannesburg to complain but trying to contact and speak to any at ba is like trying to  an audience with pope francis i eventually received an email response stating that my complaint did not qualify for any redress i then challenged this i explained that in a hypothetical situation whereas the passenger paid for their fare as they left the aircraft 1  i have been prepared to pay the full cost of the flight no and 2  ba if they were reasonable expect me to pay the full cost in summary i eventually was offered £15 credit off my next ba flight  not totally unacceptable as i do not fly that often even £15 shopping vouchers and an apology  have been sufficient i felt hugely disappointed with our national carrier and it's onboard service and the same for it's customer relations which arrogantly does not give a damn looking british-airwaysck the point that made me most angry was their total disinterest in me
 london heathrow to zurich because of fog in morning at heathrow i have called ba and checked online for delays of my late afternoon flight i was told several times that the flight was on time after a disorganized boarding the door of the aircraft was closed 15 minutes late then the captain informed us about a 45 minutes delay of departure because of fog in the morning at heathrow airport at the end we arrived with 15 hours delay in zurich when airborne we were informed about the new catering concept  of british-airways for economy class passengers on european flights you have to pay for food and the drinks thanks to the delay we spent more then two and a half hour on a ba plane and we did not receive a free glass of water
 madrid to london fairly chaotic check in largely down to the iberia staff boarding was quick and friendly welcome from cabin crew seats are cramped and on a par with low cost standards cabin was reasonably clean flight crew gave good information inflight the crew started the new food and drink sales and this was where the chaos started the time they were taking for each row they served was excruciating i was seated 9 rows british-airwaysck and gave up waiting for a drink and dozed off before landing i spoke to my neighbour and asked if they finally got served  they said the sandwiches had all run out long before staff got them this was not a cheap fare that i got and british-airways state publicly that their customers asked for this new service buy onboard etc what a lie i have yet to meet any who has been asked what they wanted in the many months before ba stopped any complimentary service sad to see our national airline has slipped well below the likes of lufthansa and air france
❎ unverified |  london heathrow to philadelphia return very good experience both flights mature crew outbound with longer waits for drinks and meal service very eneric younger crew on return where everything happened quickly and efficiently both crews friendly and had control of the cabin which made for a relaxed atmosphere food noticeably better than of late  not i hope this will continue on return my original onward flight cancelled due to fog but rebooking had been d by the time i checked in in phl and i had a text message also to that effect concorde room fine both ways though it is starting to look a little frayed but still acceptable even if the food and beverage staff do not always smile very much all in all good solid enjoyable flights i  add that this review applies to my most recent experience as others have not been so positive
" the decline of british-airways my review is primarily on ba euro traveller in economy up to two years ago  felt good when travelling ba they were miles ahead of bud airlines yes they were a bit more expensive but  enjoyed reasonable food and beverage checked in cases of 20kg all part of the service today ba provides no free food or beverage and require extra payment for check in luggage today within europe ba has absolutely no advantage opposite easyjet norwegian monarch or even ryanair why should any pay extra for ba they have lost absolutely their unique selling points incidentally coming british-airwaysck from malta to london gatwick in ba in business class there is nowhere to hang coats previously ba flight attendants always hung them in a cupboard and now no cupboards extra seats instead the decline and fall of a once proud ba in future ba will need to to meet or be cheaper than the bud airlines

 i was returning home for my wedding on december 27 2016 connecting to british-airways from london heathrow to abuja the seat i had chosen was changed to a horrible seat near the toilet i never got an explanation for this action however i was not very fussy about this as i was very excited to be ting married also the flight was dirty the food was terrible and took forever to  served in the first place our flight arrived at the abuja airport and i was supposed to  on another flight in two hours to my final destination within nigeria i went to claim my luggage at the carousel i waited for hours till all the luggage had g through and i could not find my luggage which had my wedding items in it including my wedding dress as you can imagine i was devastated i had to cancel my connecting flight to my final destination in order to sort out this issue i spent the night at abuja hoping that my luggage  come in with the flight arriving the next morning as only  ba flight arrives from heathrow to abuja each day my luggage never arrived the next day myself and my husbritish-airwaysnd had to spend a hideous amount of my purchasing emergency wedding items the ba staff at the airport were not helpful at all they were all very rude and n of them could give us any reasonable information as to where my luggage was my luggage finally arrived about 5 days after my wedding in a very british-airwaysd shape up till this day ba has refused to acknowledge my claims and they have not refunded me for all the expenses in the course of flying with them ba ruined what was supposed to be the best day of my life and i have vowed to never fly with ba 
 london heathrow to cape town return having previously flown ba first class on the boeing 777 and a380 this trip on an ageing boeing 747 not400 from heathrow terminal 3 was disappointing the sor ba replace these aircraft the better i had a window seat which at least was not as cramped as the middle seats which looked more like ba's dreadful club world seats the first disappointment came after pre notbooking meals only to be told that due to the cabin crew strike which had ended the day before we were flying we   a club world meal instead why there are only 14 first class seats and the caterers were not on strike so quite annoyed to be offered a few avios as compensation the ife screen quality was poor and the movie selection not particularly good the good thing was that we had 2 excellent ladies serving in our cabin ba need to stop treating their premium passengers with contempt and wake up to the fact there is a lot of competition priority boarding is a joke; anybody with a bronze executive club card s that so half the aircraft rush to the boarding gate priorities need re notassessing and controlling special needs and first class passengers first and then trickle down from there they also need to maintain the aircraft to a better standard or replace them more quickly
 london heathrow to chicago in first with british-airways it was better than my last trip in club world but having recently come off the british-airwaysck of an extended trip around asia not with ba  quickly realises how sub notpar most of the ba experience has become airport service at heathrow distinctly average and economy style onboard some staff friendly some surly and frankly lazy loos were not checked or cleaned throughout the flight while i do not fly to dine this was more like pub grub compared to top first class airlines and cost saving is clearly evident ife was okay trouble is there is no proper competition on this route as us carriers ca not be classified in the first class league
 san francisco to johannesburg via london the two flights were as different as night and day both night flights so the idea was to  as much sleep as possible sfo notlhr ba286 19th january was a full business class cabin but amazing service by mature flight attendants perfect mix of professionalism friendliness and efficiency although the boeing 747 had seen better days they had the main meal service d and dusted within two hours allowing for plenty of sleep lhr notjnb ba055 on 20th january was an absolute disgrace great aircraft but let down by shambolic and rude in flight service these attendants were much younger and besides looking sullen and miserable the main meal service took 4 hours  not this on a night flight post take off drinks were served relatively quickly there was then a massive gap between that and the meal order being taken and a further huge gap between the meal service being started all the while being delivered by the most miserable steward i've ever had the displeasure to encounter being a gold card holder the csm who was a delight came to give me her 'personal welcome' and i did feedbritish-airwaysck about my experience she acknowledged that these new crews are 'inexperienced' and i said that's no excuse for rudeness why can ba not mix the old and new crew toher if the newbies cannot  to grips with a british-airwayssic efficient service later had the pleasure of flying jnb notcpt on comair a ba franchise in south africa what a great little airline again very young crew but an absolute delight overall i give the journey a 6/10 but my breakdown  be sfo notlhr 9/10 lhr notjnb 2/10 jnb notcpt 9/10 i've checked the recommend box  not but if you are on a night flight with the new contract crew avoid them
 we flew from heathrow to larnaca return the aeroplane was old and tired uncomfortable seats overhead tv screens which can hardly be viewed from the seats we had chose my headphs did not work in the seat either but apart from it being a somewhat ok ish journey the offering of food and drink was shocking we can only choose food and drink from a marks and spencer's booklet believe me the food is not up to m&s quality they should never have put their good name behind this ba endeavour to cut costs whilst i accept that the system was only recently introduced and there are forced to be teething problems the fact that we can only pay for purchases by credit card which had many clients scrambling through overhead lockers was shameful what on earth are ba thinking about british-airways are seriously letting themselves down british-airwaysdly we felt like low bud airline customers although we had paid a high price for our tickets indeed if we had flown with easyjet or ryanair we  have saved ourselves hundreds of pounds i will certainly be seeking out other airlines for our frequent bookings to cyprus which amounts to at least 5 or 6 trips a year  m&s do not spoil your good reputation with this venture
 flew economy from london to manchester in august 2016 the service was really good even for this short flight the crew were smiley the food offered was okay before ba discontinued free food and drinks in 2017 and the flight departed on time london heathrow t5 was good and the queues were not too long even though it was peak summer time
 we flew british-airways from lisbon to san jose via london lisbon to london the seats were ok british-airwayssically coach seats but the middle seat is blocked off the crew on that flight was very good we were a bit apprehensive about the configuration of seats on the long haul boeing 787 from london to san jose i had a middle seat 7e but it turned out fine but definitely narrower than the seats on other airlines business class i did not need to go over anybody to  in and out however the other middle seats might not have been as easy staff on the london to san jose flight was good but not warm or personal the food quality was better than some airlines
 london to phoenix with british-airways in premium economy possibly the worst customer service and flight attendants ever both outward and inward flight the plane was dirty old and smelly the cabin crew were rude unhelpful with their customer service who simply ignore your complaints british-airways should stand for bud airline
" flew from gatwick to tampa business class on 7th january the experience can only be described as appalling the business class lounge facilities were not available due to move to south terminal we had to use the general lounge that any passenger prepared to pay £3750 could use this meant it was overcrowded and dirty through no fault of the regular staff they just could not keep up with the number of passengers we could not  a seat anywhere and when we advised ba staff of this we were told to come british-airwaysck later and see if there were any seats free the ba ground staff were completely overwhelmed by the number of business class passengers complaining and appeared at their wits end the flight was mediocre to say the least the food was average and the service satisfactory having paid £2000 for a ticket it is not unreasonable to expect a good service we formally complained to british-airways via their customer services department and the response came british-airwaysck as they were moving to the south terminal and we needed to be understanding as things   better in the future we were not even offered a refund on the tea we bought in the main area of the terminal as we could not  into the lounge they had provided this is not good customer service and we will not in future travel with british-airways we will be travelling virgin even if it means we have to  several connecting flights to our destination

 flew british-airways from miami to london heathrow on 15th january and the aircraft was filthy in economy class pulled out the tiny tv from under the armrest and there was hair attached opened the armrest to retrieve table and the dirt was disgusting this has been an accumulation over a long period of time tv did not work and after 3 hours into a 85 hour flight and the attendant trying to re notboot it 3 times i finally asked what could be d i had paid extra for a seat that had extra leg room seat 29a as there is no seat in front and you could stretch right out there was a seat free in business class but the manager on the flight made it clear that he was 'not allowed' to move me i traveled business class on the outbound flight on 3rd jan but did not feel that it was value for my i will stick with emirates or virgin in the future as i know the aircraft are clean with good customer service i logged this complaint onboard at the time but a week later still heard nothing does not surprise me
 london heathrow to dubritish-airwaysi and a delayed flight poor communications from lhr british-airways staff horrible food crowded flight and a mars mini bite size for breakfast unmotivated crew all the my they have made seems to go to senior management a disgrace and sad to have experienced and will avoid them
 never again booked a round trip from to london from paris return with british-airways in business as had a separate ticket from paris to johannesburg with af in business class and cape town to paris with qatar in business class on the outbound flight no issues apart from the appalling lounge in london t5 checked in for my return flight online and to my surprise they charge for booking your seat before check in opening which i found strange being a business class passenger the reason i chose the ba flight was that it was from the same airport cdg as where my flight from cape town via doha arrived and after a long haul flight the last thing i wanted was to have any hassle with the connection to london the plan was to  refreshed in the lounge rest for few hours and  on the flight unfortunately my plans were trashed when i arrived at the check in and was told that my flight had been cancelled and that i had been rebooked from orly which is an hour away it did not stop there no transfer was provided and when asked how do i  there the unfriendly reply was well  a bus no indication of where the woman simply turned away from me and started talking to a colleague tried to  some more information to which the reply was go online she gave me a paper which i thought  be a map to the bus but it turned out to be a sheet of guidelines on how to  compensation thought ok at least something the next shock when i arrived in orly the check in lady told me that instead of business they had put me in economy as i was very tired and just wanted to  home agreed but asked if could still use the lounge oh no not possible at this point i was absolutely appalled and asked to speak to the manager was told that it was not possible and that i could go online and complain gave up and went through security to find out that the flight was delayed again spoke to the same lady who tried to ignore me and kept repeating go online i do not care about ba when british-airwaysck home complained to customer services and got a reply that no compensation was due as they had ran out of staff to operate that flight complained again as had the paper from the cdg ground crew about compensation generic reply after 5 minutes was no compensation needless to say i will never fly with ba again which is a shame as do like other world partners who i frequently fly with in business class and am a ff luckily not of ba
not fair for the fare flew bangkok to paris via london with british-airways not allowed to choose our seats the cabin was not clean lot of dust 8 seats per row in business no privacy 50% of the seats do not have direct access to the aisle bad meals in small portions not enough toilets tiny ptv screen and poor movie selection crew was very friendly and helpful we had to face the british-airwaysd mood of the ground staff in london who were very aggressive and refused to let us take our hand luggage on the london to paris flight we explained that we were in business class and that we flew with the same cases at the beginning of our vacation they did not care and refused us to bring it on board after 30 minutes i showed that they were of a size allowed by ba they recognized their mistake and let us take it 30 minutes of stress because they did not do their job properly wo not fly ba again except for the cabin crew everything was british-airwaysd and looking like bud airline
glasgow to london gatwick with british-airways absolutely ludicrous approach to carry on british-airwaysggage allowance on this flight i arrived at my seat as the plane was only approximately a third boarded and already the overhead lockers in the 3 or 4 rows either side were jammed to capacity with huge british-airwaysgs that could not possibly have came even close to the permitted size allowed for a cabin i struggled to squeeze my jacket into a gap between 2 massive cases and had to keep my small british-airwaysckpack containing only my change of clothes between my feet for the flight no idea how how such visibly oversized and overweight british-airwaysgs were allowed onboard but it made for a pretty uncomfortable flight pretty disappointing from an airline whose standards seem to be sliding british-airwaysdly
british-airways is a very good airline yesterday i was coming british-airwaysck from bangkok to london and i missed my flight because i feel asleep at the airport i had a sleepless night and food poisoning they did me big favour and booked next available flight next day free of charge never happened to me with another airline very impressed
 london to cape town galleries lounge at t3 tatty and overcrowded takeoff delayed by an hour because of weather issues but we were kept well informed while waiting for push british-airwaysck seats 62j/k on upper deck excellent for a couple although the plane was looking its age with patching up wherever you looked ife long past its due replacement date with small screen and poor resolution cabin crew friendly enough meal the usual sub notstandard ba fare with diminishing portion sizes and overcooked mains hotel chocolat chocs have now disappeared arrival at cpt only 30 mins behind schedule cape town to london the galleries lounge at cpt spacious but quickly became packed with pax from two flights food options dreadful with the worst hot food we've encountered in any business class lounge cheese pre notpackaged mcc available but no champagne push british-airwaysck 15 mins ahead of schedule same seats on upper deck meal british-airwaysrely average and we avoided the hot option at breakfast arrived ahead of schedule overall the flight itself was the usual ba service onboard was another matter with seats and service way below ba's competitors and at inflated prices
in september 2016 i flew with british-airways in first from london to kuala lumpur on flight ba0033 initial impressions were positive the check notin was efficient with polite and friendly staff the concorde room was a nice place to be my first suite 2a offered a good amount of comfort space and privacy fast forward 12+ hours would i fly in british-airways first again no would i fly with british-airways again no this is why: on the flight there were two members of cabin crew in the first cabin with 8 passengers the 1st cabin crew member was polite and professional the 2nd cabin crew member was extremely unprofessional the supplied headph set was faulty and did not work i had to ask twice for a replacement set it took over 40 minutes to receive this once airborne i ordered a cappuccino i had to ask three times for this and wait over 50 minutes for it to arrive there were multiple issues with my dinner:  not i was the second person to order my dinner; yet the last person to be served it took over 2 hours to  my dinner some who had ordered after me got my dinner option i was told some 30 minutes after placing my order that only  option was available it  appear that this passenger had a higher executive club membership and therefore was given my choice of main course i was only given the option of a club world main course which was delayed further as i was initially given the wrong order this delay in service had a detriment to my own sleeping plans and i was extremely disappointed at the service from the 2nd cabin crew member there were issues with my breakfast: despite being the first passenger to wake up and order my breakfast another passenger was served first and given my breakfast i ordered a cappuccino; the 2nd cabin crew member ignored this order when i enquired again some 40 minutes after i had placed my order i was told that the seat belt sign was now on and therefore i could not have this i was extremely disappointed as at the material time i placed my order and for some time after this there had been no seat belt sign displayed the first cabin toilet was not cleaned properly throughout the flight formal complaint within 24 hours of landing in kul i wrote a formal letter of complaint outlining the aforementid issues and emailed this to the ceo of british-airways alex cruz the ‘you first department at british-airways confirmed receipt of my email subsequently i received a very generic response from british-airways customer relations no attempt was made to address or even explore the issues that gave rise to my complaint this was disappointing i was simply offered 10000 avios points i responded by return rejecting this offer and again asked for an explanation to why i had received such poor service during my flight and why no attempt had been made by british-airways to address the issues that i had outlined in my formal complaint the response from british-airways customer relations was again disappointing and did not offer any explanation other than the matter  be dealt with internally and that the gesture of 10000 avios points was because british-airways “have to be consistent so were fair to all our customers” i found this statement somewhat ironic
 st petersburgh to london i dont know where ba got this market research to say stop complementary meals we prefer to pay for it  ive yet to find any who agrees with this idea and certainly no  asked me for my opinion if you want to buy something different you always have the option in the endless airport shops before boarding i suggest they look seriously at their market research company if this is true though i suspect the real reason is cost cutting ba just doesnt want to admit it ba  be better off to admit it customers  have more sympathy than trying to promote this policy as some benefit to the customer when clearly they are removing benefit and keeping price the same we can all see through the attempted deception and it does the image no good to tell me that charging £180 for water or soft drink is a british-airwaysrgain when i can buy the same thing in tesco for 63p insults my intelligence they are exploiting the fact that passengers cannot carry liquids through security so they have a captive market again a great image to promote to the world where possible myself and family will now actively seek to avoid being a ba passenger where any alternative exists pay extra for checked luggage pay extra for drinks pay extra for food im sorry to see our flag carrier in such a state that it is reduced to that of a bud airline
 british-airways is a bud airline at premium airline prices flew from gatwick to cancun however if you wanted snacks on a very long flight you have to buy them on board and with a long flight and meals only at the beginning and end people  hungry you do not expect to have to buy snacks on such an expensive flight there was also nowhere to plug in laptops which you expect on a long and expensive flight notespecially when you have work to do the plane was also so cold too cold to concentrate on work it  take a great deal to choose them again
 shanghai to zurich via london return and british-airways is absolutely appalling i have never experienced such terrible customer service from an airline i booked two return premium economy seats for my mother and i to go from shanghai to zurich via london on the way there the flight to zurich was cancelled due to french strike not ba's fault so that part is clear however they kept the flight on the board until very last minute then told every it was cancelled furthermore they ran out of hotels to put people up and we wasted about 5 hours after a 12 hours flight to go through customs thank god we can enter visa free unlike a few other passengers find a hotel arrange our own transport there and british-airwaysck so the first leg already left a terrible impression then on the way british-airwaysck to shanghai they overbooked business so they pushed business passengers into premium economy and then pushed my elderly mother and i to economy for a 12 hour flight i booked premium economy for a reason my mum has health issues and need the room in premium economy did ba care no told us that we were involuntarily downgraded upon check in but that likely we will still  a seat then at boarding told us sorry it's either fly economy now or wait till tomorrow to see if there is a seat because i had work the next day we had no option but to fly and ba ushered us on with the promise that they will put in the fare difference request on my behalf which will be processed asap three months down the track i have yet to see a single cent of fare difference and of course there are no customer service ph numbers/emails to write to only an impersonal link online for you to submit a reference and compliant to their customer service black hole needless to say i will forever boycott ba for its incompetence and insincerity towards a paying customer 
 we travelled business class from gatwick to barbritish-airwaysdos return for christmas 2016 the outbound flight plane had not been cleaned well at all  not food crumbs around seat area stained carpets wet toilet floors etc the cabin crew member was not aware of taking passenger coat procedure and suggested we hang it up wherever you can find space  not we collected our own coats prior to landing when the food was served we had been noted as 'not eating'  not when the mistake was realised and the mistake initially made by the senior stewardess the two hot options were unavailable  not i had cheese and biscuits and my husbritish-airwaysnd went without the quality of the video/audio was very poor  not the picture clarity poor and the sound distorted making certain films unwatchable on the return flight the executive lounge was fully booked and we had to use the packed lounge in the main terminal during the inbound flight the young cabin steward was constantly chewing gum  not not a very professional image on our return the only response by ba to our complaints was additional avios points  not an unacceptable response a fair and reasonable complaint and an offer that we are unlikely to take advantage of
 well i've checked in online hoping that it  actually speed things up when at the airport silly me the queue was ridiculous for british-airwaysg drop and i had to spend over 2 hours waiting to drop my british-airwaysg the queue for assisted check in was far quicker – i think that things got inverted now maybe quicker to check in at the airport so i was hoping to have had time to eat before the flight british-airways were completely under staffed and disorganised there were no signs of people trying to indicate where we should go considering the massive queues total fail i felt i was flying with a low cost airline i kept checking the flight details for any planned delays  not it was obvious that it was going to be massively delayed because of snow etc but the monitor and alerts were indicating departure at 1022 instead of the planned departure at 1000 well that was the case until 5 minutes before 1022 finally we got 'updated' i doubt that this was only known at that time why was not there an update before anyway new departure time scheduled for 1159 we only started boarding at 1100 then inside the cabin we waited for another hour until taking off at no point did ba offer vouchers we only ate inside the cabin after 2am the flight was terrible but that's another story i see no point at flying with ba for a few years now staff are old and 'entitled' when you are not lucky enough to fly in a modern aircraft you are presented with filthy dirty seats food ting worse and worse and in board entertaining – almost non notexistent a few years ago you could actually slowly save miles nowadays you  almost nothing ba used to be good not just an ordinary lazy airline living from its glories
 i paid almost £300 to fly from london to frankfurt the flight took off and then was re notrouted british-airwaysck to london because of weather and german air space closing the communication to passengers was horrible and it took two hours waiting in line to  a hotel room only to learn they still had not rebooked my flight while waiting in line i tried multiple times to call their customer service number and was on hold for twenty minutes at a time before hanging up due to international cell ph costs the rebooked flight landed 22 hours after my original flight was supposed to land and even that flight was delayed because of broken air conditioning which was identified after we already boarded and were sitting on the tarmac during a rare london heatwave i landed almost a day later than planned but my british-airwaysg did not make it from london for another four days british-airways provided no guidance for which british-airwaysggage and delay related expenses they'd reimburse yet then denied portions of my claim the delays lost british-airwaysggage and frustrating experience dealing with them really ruined the first part of my holiday i complained to their customer service team and after a lot of british-airwaysck and forth they offered a 20 pound travel voucher such a horrible experience with this airline will never fly them again
 flight from athens to heathrow delayed by 30 minutes which seems to be the norm for this flight with ba however a few minutes before call to board an announcement came over that that no food nor drink  be available on this flight no explanation as to the reason fortunately i was in the business lounge so grabbed a can of coke and a couple of rolls but for others they  have no time to purchase anything even if they are happy to pay airport prices this was a 4 hour flight by the way i had no idea that ba are now charging for food and drink even for water they kept that  quiet i rarely travel with hold luggage so now have to pay extra for the luxury of choosing a half decent seat they kept that  quiet as well when this policy was introduced last spring how long before they start charging for airport check in or duplicate documents the same as ryanair will they be selling lottery tickets next pay notas notyou go toilet british-airways still refer to themselves as the worlds favourite airline based on who`s opinion exactly see no point in using ba now they usually come out as  of the most expensive carriers when choosing a route they have the most ignorant and unhelpful cabin staff out of any other carriers i fly about 100 times annually through business and try and avoid ba with this latest my grabbing scam i will change my scheduling to avoid them there are plenty other quality carriers who like ba are struggling to maintain profits all have the same threat of terrorism fluctuating oil prices adverse weather air nottraffic control strikes etc but they are not punishing the very people who keep their planes in the air
we had the pleasure of flying british-airwaysck to the uk on the first day of ba's fantastic idea of starting to charge for drinks and snacks a la sister company iberia some please explain to me what the difference is with ryanair easyjet and norwegian now it's become a bud airline and i for  wo not be using them anymore if i can avoid it they cut the avios for flights made it more difficult to go up tiers and now this joke i'm not even bothered about the sandwich to be really hst but on a 4 hour flight i expect ba to give me a drink then when i wanted to buy a sandwich i was told that there were only 3 for the entire plane and they sold out salad then sold out some crisps unfortunately the person in front of me got the last british-airwaysg ba you are not iberia or air lingus stop this nonsense please take an example to klm the week before ams  not mad hot pasta 2 rounds of drinks and then cake with coffee or tea and that was economy also i will avoid ba like the plague now sorry but no appeal whatsoever anymore until they become a customer focused airline once again instead of focussing on just their profits
 houston to london heathrow in business class the service from the cabin crew was less attentive and organised than the outbound flight british-airways used a boeing 777 plane rather than the 747 used on the outward journey this meant there was no upper deck seating the seats are comfortable and convert to flat beds both journeys provided a welcome drink and 3 course menu i found i was still hungry after the meal so made use of the snacks available at the british-airwaysr i used the arrivals lounge at lhr which was great to have a shower and some breakfast
flew london gatwick to cancun in business class on a b777 that looked in need of a major refurbishment the cabin was drab and dated; the entertainment screen was small and the choice limited; the food was for business class not particularly good quality and poorly presented  not in particular the second meal on an 11 hour flight was a packet of sandwiches and some cake i am quite capable of opening my own packet of sandwiches but given the price of flying business class i'd have thought ba could make some effort to present the food better in summary the experience compared very british-airwaysdly to asian or middle eastern airlines i've used

 london to hong kong return through no fault of our own very late notrunning bus major road accident and a driver who threw us off in the cargo area and told us to wait for the next bus – my friend and i missed our 1830 flight to hong kong on december 12th we thought we  be re notbooked on the later 2050 flight especially since we had business class tickets instead we were told by the ba official at the misnamed ‘customer services desk that we had ‘voluntarily missed our plane i assume that was code for ‘its your fault not our problem; that was certainly what his attitude conveyed we were then offered 3 options – pay a supplement of £1478 to take the 2050 flight take a downgrade to premium economy without a guarantee that ba  reimburse us the difference in seat price or wait four days the ba official couldnt have been less flexible or sympathetic and ba has responded to my complaint via twitter with the same disinterest my travel companions business class seat was a gift for her 60th birthday any pleasure she might have got from it and mine in giving it to her were ruined by the way we were treated on the half notempty flight british-airwaysck on new years eve the crew obviously didnt want to be there was british-airwaysrely courteous and when my friend a diabetic enquired what  be in her special meal she was told no not knew they clearly didnt care either they did very grudgingly eventually agree that she could order from the regular menu after making it clear that this was an exception and a ‘privilege she was being granted i  have thought and expected a little more courtesy and grace especially in business class god knows how the poor souls in the british-airwaysck were treated i have given my preference to ba for years in order to support my home airline sadly i dont think they deserve my custom any longer so the next time we fly to asia we will take  of the gulf airlines who at least give the impression that they want and value your custom bas only concern these days is profit at any price; their customer service is as poor as any ive ever come across and their corporate motto ‘to fly to serve an embritish-airwaysrrassing joke ive flown with them several times a year for the last 35 years but i wont be doing it again unless it cant possibly be avoided the saddest thing of all is that i dont think british-airways will give a damn
 london heathrow to prague i've been commuting to and from work for last six and half years the only airline that takes me to london heathrow is british-airways sometimes i fly there and british-airwaysck up to two times a week i do not eat on flights so i thought ba's decision to charge for food was not gonna upset me too much however they've managed i always bring my own good quality tea and a cup and ask crew for some hot water drink my tea and go to sleep to my surprise i am not allowed to  hot water anymore in fact i am not allowed to  any water on ba shorthaul flight unless i pay even if i bring my own cup and tea or unless it's medical emergency then i could  cup of cold water for free so not only they did not lower the fare but they also sucessfully joined bud airline bunch by charging even for water to my great regret they are the only airline that takes me to heathrow so i ca not take my custom anywhere else unless i change job but if i am to fly on holiday british-airways will not be my chosen carrier ever again
 london heathrow to amman it was my first time to fly the a321 ex notbmi aircraft in business class on ba and i really like the layout that feels so spacious the service was great throughout and the cabin crew were active in checking if passengers needed anything the check notin queues in amman were annoying but other than that this london notamman notlondon trip reminded me of how flying used to be
" london heathrow to rome return outbound with an a320 and inbound a boeing 767 outbound flight was delayed due to engine problem just before taking off with consequent 5 hours delays ba did look after us well though replacement aircraft found another a320 and we safely arrived to destination cabin crew was very helpful and polite return on an old but still good looking b767 i believe they will be phased out in 2017 which has plenty of legroom and space in economy although the overhead bins are not too spacious i guess that is the way they used to be we departed and landed on time overall a good experience despite the outbound delay but i prefer airlines that are able to make safety calls to those that  not

 london gatwick to barbritish-airwaysdos return we were appalled with the change to economy onboard meals on both outgoing and return flights to barbritish-airwaysdos after take off we were served complimentary drinks as usual but noted the preztals had been abolished but was not unduly concerned dinner was served shortly afterwards which i was good although cheese and biscuits had been cut too the flight time was almost 9 hours so we were feeling hungry 4 hours after the main meal i was looking forward to a sandwich or at least a croissant to take the hunger off and was completely shocked when the cabin staff came round with a tray and offered us either a mini size kit kat a small british-airwaysg of crisps or 2 small biscuits the cabin staff told me it was the new policy and that if we wanted we could buy snacks which she then told us was in fact a small box of pringles  there were not even any sandwiches for sale fortunately for us soon after a women came through from premium economy and joined a queue for the loo and i noticed she was carrying a sandwich i asked her where she had got it and she replied that it had been given to her and did we want it  no  advised us that there was only  meal in 9 hours if so we  have bought a sandwich with us i looked through the onboard magazine and there was no list of snacks or anything about these severe cut british-airwayscks so if your planning on travelling with british-airways economy to barbritish-airwaysdos make sure you pack a sandwich return flight we was prepared as only a biscuit was given out will be travelling with virgin next time
 travelled british-airways from london to kuala lumpur return had a painful 13 hour fight as i had a window seat with a metal box in the leg room areas which meant my feet were slanted to  side throughout the flight on my way british-airwaysck the inflight entertainment did not work after numerous attempts to reset by the cabin crew it still did not work for my partner and i for the price of the ticket this was not acceptable

 manchester to los angeles via heathrow i'm always reminded that british-airways is  of the worst airlines every time i fly with them the check in service is as british-airwaysd as they  they have sent my british-airwaysgs to heathrow even though i'm going to lax i expect them to know check or at least ask where i'm going to make things worse the ground staff proceed to suggest that its my fault because i booked two separate tickets which i know for a fact that i did not because i booked a round notthe notworld flight staff have attitude across the board poor food on long haul flights struggling to think of many ways they could be worse a real embritish-airwaysrrassment that british-airways is my country's main airline
" manchester to las vegas via manchester i went to the trouble of checking in online printing boarding pass etc and expecting to just drop my british-airwaysg at the airport to be told that is not allowed i was told i had no option but to queue up with everybody else checking in after 1 hour in the horrific queue i am told there is no space for a british-airwaysg drop at manchester t3 the agent said this with 4 empty check notin desks next to her british-airways disgust me with this hoop notjumping checking in online which only serves the airline and left me in agony on my feet thank you for the complimentary micro notbritish-airwaysg of crisps on the delayed lhr notman leg if i never see ba/aa ever again it'll be too soon

 miami to london business class living in london and flying international long haul flights throughout the year i have once again been disappointed by british-airways poor maintenance for premium amenities in preferred cabins our family of four were travelling home from the christmas holidays on an overnight flight and when i was ready to sleep i attempted to recline my seat in the flat bed position my seat  not recline the flight was completely full and there were no other seats available to switch me to these are simple checks a maintenance crew could and should go through prior to boarding an aircraft i notified the flight attendant to see if he had any knowledge as to how the seat could be adjusted in an attempt to fix it sadly he did not i was informed that the head/purser was on his crew rest and that he  come discuss the situation with me in an hour and a half hopefully his accommodations were better than mine prior to landing 20 minutes before on a 9 hour flight the purser spoke to me and apologised on behalf of ba and said he could compensate me with either £50 or 10000 avios i informed him there was a far greater price point between premium economy vs business class understandably he apologised and said that was all he was capable of doing i received a call from a ba representative and i was informed that she could only provide me with similar compensation  not £50 or 10000 avios i currently have 588500 avois on ba that is nearly impossible to use i requested an upgrade on an upcoming flight from heathrow to atlanta from a premium economy seat to a business class seat the ba representative said that she could not do this as customers pay for the business class experience  not the food individual flight attendant service and comfort sleeping is the entire point of purchasing a business class seat  not not the food my comfort was not met the flight attendants on ba have always been very professional irregardless of the cabin the point was to sleep
 i've flown this route sydney to london many times with other airlines and british-airways is the worst they changed our seats during the fuel stop at singapore  not without notice without explanation the food was terrible  not no fruit or green veable to be seen cabin staff stomp up and down the aisle attending to premium economy  not bumped into numerous times toilet locations on board are terrible  not those poor people seated right next to the wc door paid extra for reserved seats  not no confirmation inflight entertainment was awful  not really really old movies this airline trades on some nostalgic image as if they were in the 1950's other airlines are far superior do not risk it  not you'll be disappointed
 paris cdg to bangkok via london heathrow in business class it was my first flight with ba and probritish-airwaysbly my last  ba is the perfect example what an airline becomes after too much cost cutting in business class each row has 8 seats never seen that in a recent business class and you can for any privacy the seat is comfortable in sitting position but becomes not comfy in bed position as you have to open a second tiny seat to put your feet not convenient the ife screen is tiny smaller than in economy in recent airplanes the movie selection was very poor the meal was british-airwaysd and quantity was very poor 3 tiny toilets for the business class not enough
 london heathrow to hong kong was the most disappointing business class experience the bottom line is that ba had 8 business class seats in a row on this boeing 777 from lhr to hkg the seats on ba are narrow lack privacy the face of a stranger next to me facing in the opposite direction was about 2 feet 60 cm from me and do not even dream about any storage space i could not find a flat surface to place my eyeglasses on and i kept my water bottle on the floor under the seat the footrest had to be operated manually the entire experience was so irritating that i did not know whether i should complain or just laugh at it i have no idea how ba can  away with this they certainly wo not see me as a customer again
 toronto to london return in club world on 787 not900 with british-airways outbound was upgraded a couple of months ago from world traveller plus worth the my for a decent night's sleep fast check in and fast track security at pearson meant i was in the lounge within 15 mins excellent lounge supper service with a choice of a roast or noodles in soup the lounge is well managed and maintained with friendly staff and a well stocked british-airwaysr on time boarding but a delayed departure due to loading british-airwaysggage a glass of champagne with a top up before departure i always find boarding in club world disjointed and fragmented as crew from world traveler assist making the pre departure service erratic a fast drinks service and supper were served with lights out a well timed late breakfast meant a decent 5 hours sleep on this leg and my food choices were actually available priority british-airwaysgs beat me to the british-airwaysggage belt the return leg was enhanced due to being upgraded 24 hours before departure clearly oversold for such early action but welcome as a ba silver member the flight was  of my best business class flights and reminded me of the old ba i knew and loved fast british-airwaysr service d by tray and not by cart an excellent meal of roast chicken with a delicious caramel desert plated too and some decent wines the only reduction in service spotted this time was the wine list was down to two reds two whites and no rose that said the wines were very good the cabin crew excelled throughout with the two crew professional friendly and delivering excellent customer service promptly when asked afternoon tea is a now a bit of let down with the scs dropped an early landing and prompt british-airwaysgs on the belt completed a stellar trip british-airwaysck home if only ba could deliver this standard consistently with an improved product and friendly crew and sort out the flawed and outdated seat layout then there is a chance ba could return to it's former glory
 london heathrow to lima after my rave review of norwegian to california i find myself british-airwaysck on british-airways on my regular trip to south america no delays on departure and well ordered boarding but despite the smiles british-airways staff just ca not quite reach out to passengers as was the norwegian experience tired grey boeing 777 interior does not help either okay the rudiments of a service are there but come on who decided no alcoholic drinks served with dinner or replace the afternoon tea with a box of sickly snacks and half a tumbler of water to later serve quite a tasty lunch with just coffee or tea  pokey tv screen but okay ife programme choice i suppose this is the best we can expect but with so called low cost airlines doing so much better the main carriers deserve to lose ground
 on my way home on 1st january 2017 athens to lhr the flight ba633 had 3 hours delayed departure despite the fact this ticket costs £220 and an addition of a £20 for a seat which later came down to £8 and an astonishing 70 euros for luggage the only thing that we were offered inflight was a sandwich no headphs to watch the in flight entertainment and  i had a fault on the lights above the seats this airline is going down fast and i will be happy to see this happening if it was not for some hardworking crew members which try to salvage the reputation of ba i will try not to fly them again they are worse than ryanair at least with ryanair you know what to expect ba has the logo to fly to serve i think it should be changed: to fly to rip off and make your lives a hell on the air
 stockholm to denver via london heathrow the boeing 747 not400 was very old and the inflight entertainment system had a small screen with very low resolution the movies were quite limited the seats were okay but compared to seats in new airplane they were quite dated there was limited space for storage both british-airwaysgs and stuff in the seat pocket a blanket and a pillow was provided for transatlantic flight and the food was reasonably good all and all not a british-airwaysd experience  not but compared to modern airlines it was a very dated experience i flown several of airline transatlantic and this was by far the poorest experience given cabin features entertainment food and comfort
 london heathrow to tehran return the check in staff could have been a little more flexible although a few friends and my british-airwaysggage were overweight and eventually due to a friend ting an upgrade we managed to sort it all out  i was disappointed with the lack of food provided by british-airways on this flight g are the days where you  a pack of peanuts with the drink early on in the flight the muslim meal was really not nice at all and i should have stuck with the same options others had which was actually meant to be very nice i was so tired however outbound and inbound i found the seats to be decent inflight entertainment was quite good too did have to ask for a fresh set of ear phs however british-airways just do not seem to be in the same league as others such as qatar airways emirates virgin etc
 cancun to london gatwick with british-airways the worst breakfast i've ever had i was looking forward to my first flight with british-airways thinking that they were a leading airline in my view they are nothing special i was looking forward to a nice breakfast before landing british-airwaysck at gatwick from mexico we were given a cheese roll yoghurt and a cereal british-airwaysr i could not eat the cheese roll as it was so bland ate the yoghurt and saved the cereal british-airwaysr for my 2 hour drive home okay i got a good price and flew economy but that's exactly what i got  not a flight that seemed to focus on economy i  be happy from now on to pay more for another airline
 madrid to montreal via london heathrow coming british-airwaysck from my hymoon me and my wife had our luggage misplaced and is missing over the holidays 3 weeks of clothes in our suitcases and no  is able to give us answers to where it is or why it's missing i ca not even  a hold of any in their offices to speak to in regards to a claim every says to do it online sure and how long is it going to take for some to  british-airwaysck to me this is not a way to handle customers i will make sure to never fly on british-airways again
 having read so many negative reviews on this site regarding british-airways and their first class product i was somewhat concerned as to what the experience  be like on our first class flight from lhr notsan on ba273 on their b747 not400 i need not have worried this flight was excellent on all aspects our domestic connecting flight from man notlhr was delayed by 2 hours due to fog at lhr the captain  came into the gate area and explained the reasons of the delay and invited questions from any concerned passengers about their connecting flights in lhr luckily we had planned 4 hours into our itinerary so the delay caused us no problems passengers with tight connections at lhr were offered alternative connection options the concorde lounge in lhr t5 ba first class passengers was superb with professional and courteous staff we had booked a cabritish-airwaysna and spa treatments both were superb and highly recommended plan time into your itinerary to enjoy these to the full the lounge offers a la carte dining and the food was excellentpromptly champagne and great wines were also available onboard the ba747 in the first cabin we had seats 2a & 2k these offered great comfort for the 11 hour flight the seats were made into a bed by the cabin crew when you requested it i got 6 hours sleep good quality quilts and pillows helped this seats 1a or 1k may have been slightly better for a couple travelling toher as they are closer toher than 2a 2k but this is not a negative issue the meal service was excellent dine when you want excellent choice of aperitifs wines and champagne the young cabin crew offered excellent attentive service in a very professional manner throughout the 11 hour flight first class seats offer good privacy probritish-airwaysbly centre seats 4ef and 5ef offer the least privacy and therefore i  avoid these where possible ba first is in a league of it's own and miles ahead of club both in the air and on the ground well d ba this really was a first class experience in every meaning of the words
flew london gatwick to tampa with british-airways gatwick is a modern airport but check notin was slow as was security in the departure hall plenty of places to eat and shop gate shown about an hour before departure waited for 30 not45 mins at gate as plane was delayed by about 20 minutes boarding took a very long time as it was a full flight once on board the aircraft we departed quicklythe seats was pretty old but just about comfortable enough once in the air immigration cards are handed out followed by a drink service but no pretzels like ba used to do about 2 hours after take off food was served chicken curry or veable lasagna lunch was quite nice but small after lunch duty free was sold four hours into the flight the cabin lights were turned off the ife was ok there were lots of movies and tv shows but not many games also the screen went fuzzy when the moving map was on screen was small but touch screen still worked between meals there were snacks available but they had to be paid for there used to be a free snack box drinks were also avaliable and free between meals an hour before a sandwich kitkat and a drink were served the size was not adequate but tasted nice after the service was cleared plane stared the long descent into tampa airport once we landed it was a long walk to immigration however the queue was short overall the flight was not british-airwaysd not much food but crew were helpful and attentive
 my family and i were flying from dubritish-airwaysi to london on 19th december we had our 4 children including our 2 year old twin girls who were flying for the first time after an hour into the journey the twins started to cry we tried comforting them walking with them etc but could not stop them i went to the galley and requested for a snack for my daughters and was told the meal will be served shortly however it took an hour at least to serve the meal the twins continued crying as they did not eat the main meal i went to the galley and stood there waiting for assistance and was ignored eventually a steward came to collect a trolley for business class and saw me waiting and asked if he could help i explained the situation to him and he gave me a packet which contained two biscuits i thanked him and left the cabin staff  rather have other passengers disturbed by aggravated tired hungry children has lost my custom and i wo not be flying with ba ever again

 ba 869 from budapest on 17th december was delayed by fog at heathrow the captain took the trouble to broadcast a message to waiting passengers in the departure lounge he explained very succinctly about the fog delay and made sure we knew there was no guarantee about take notoff time he gave passengers the choice not to fly if the delay was going to be a problem for them he explained we need to be onboard ready to fly at a moment's notice but we could be waiting 4 to 5 hours we boarded and fortunately were away only two and a half hours late i had never known that kind of communication before with delays i  like our appreciation to be passed on to the captain and crew that day
frankfurt to cape town via london heathrow the short haul legs were short and efficient and seat is standard for european business class the salad was good i did not like the dessert heathrow to cape town on old boeing 747 not400 and even though this is still  of my favorite aircraft the business class on was the old  the seat itself was comfortable and i prefer to be shielded from other passengers but no stowage space for small items around your seat not possible to watch tv during take off there is not much to watch anyway and a dirty seat and cabin no usb plug or at least an international plug but only a uk plug how international the full flat bed is good if you are shorter than 187cm this is the only airline in business class long haul that has 6 seat in a row the service was good but needs some nicer touches though look at what others are offering british-airways are way behind the cabin crew was professional and friendly and it all came down to the attendant on our side she gave her all to ensure a good flightit is sad that legacy carriers now go the same road as low cost carriers instead of opting for better quality
 baltimore washington to london heathrow bad start for my first trip on british-airways extra cost for decent seat meant nothing bought a mid notcabin seat for my wife and i flight delayed 45 hours due to mechanical problem so for the insult of paying for reasonable seats my wife and i were rebooked in the very last row of the aircraft  not no refund just shoulder shrugs about it being a different aircraft this caused us to miss our connecting flight to venice thereby incurring a 7 hour wait at heathrow overall a loss of a half day thinking that ba  want to at for royally jobbing us on the flights was wasted a couple of low cost vouchers for small meals were provided a suggestion that access to the british-airways lounge  be a class way to assuage the delay was met with a look of astonishment no real remorse matter of fact responses like gee this happens a lot and good luck no customer loyalty sought dispassionate professional but not really friendly staff seemed tired and overworked at counters
 london heathrow to prague as a gold exec member i was mortified to find out that as a gold member we were not allowed to choose a seat or exit seat my seat allocation may have been in the rear toilet it was that far british-airwaysck also finding out meals are being stopped in economy and you can only pay with avios or card this has in my opinion put a great name into the league of of other cheap airlines how sad but clearly some in charge at the moment is feeling smug and feels that is going to improve customer choice why do you think people chose british-airways as they are more expensive because of the service and being like it used to be to fly without taking a picnic with you 
 this was a much better flight than our outward lhr notbkk with british-airways the staff were on the british-airwaysll worked hard and always around a nice plane good ife with wide modern screen seats were fine although storage lacking compared to a380 food still a letdown  chicken served in kebritish-airwaysbs but far too sweet and soggy white wine good red poor breakfast scrambled eggs and steak spoilt by having a greasy liquid in the bottom of tray rendering pretty well inedible i got a decent sleep
 dubritish-airwaysi to toronto via london and i tried to check notin online however this was blocked and upon enquiry to bas unhelpful customer contact centre i was told it was a “random” security hold by airport authorities when i questid that the supervisor changed the story to  of needing eta for travel to canada when i informed her that could not be the case as i was a dual uk notcanadian citizen she changed the story to  of it being ascribed to the company but that it could not be changed because of the website only after repeated complaints did she bother to take my canadian passport details and lift the block previously described as out of bas control the second joy i had with lovely ba and staff was at heathrow during transit as i had a 6 nothour layover i elected not to go to transit and to meet my parents instead at t5 arrivals upon entering departures i was stopped by  of ba senior managers who forced me to check in my carry noton luggage despite it being cleared by ba in dubritish-airwaysi but was more than happy to let some other passengers with same sized carry on through perhaps she is the model random manager ba aspires to for future leadership in any case this “manager” was so eager to check by carry on in that she left a whole bunch of company documentation with me at the check notin agents location such is the competency and class of this “manager” but then again  can expect no less from ba either finally at toronto the checked in carry on came half nothour after the already delayed regular checked notin luggage – adding salt to wound i flew to london from dubritish-airwaysi several times last year on emirates and on klm/delta/air france to toronto at multiple other times and never had any issues with security or carry noton from any of them finally i called the uk customer relations center from toronto but i gave up about being put on hold for almost 7 minutes they are incompetent and unhelpful in that field too i wish i could give this rotten airline 0/10 but the minimum is 1/10 and i am happy with that
london heathrow to copenhagen after many horrible experiences on ba i am convinced this airline has total contempt not only for its customers but even for top tier elite frequent flyers i am aa executive platinum and i am being treated worse than cattle  not forced to check in carry noton british-airwaysg which is within the ba limits on multiple occasions denied boarding zero upgrade policy zero flexibility when being forcefully re notbooked recently i had to pay £300 in addition to an already expensive £400 ticket for a 2 hr eu flight i live in london and i'm a loyal american airlines frequent flyer clocking around 200000 miles a year i will avoid british-airways even if it means an extra connection flying a low cost carrier or not flying at all
 london gatwick to antigua return the charge to reserve your seat is extortionate the check in staff at gatwick were miserable to the point of rudeness the inflight meal was appalling and the pre arrival meal/snack was a joke british-airways is run by bean counters who want to charge / extricate the maximum amount of my for the minimum expenditure no wonder british-airways are slipping down the ratings lists
 kiev to belfast via london heathrow my last two flights on british-airways have been a nightmare the first flight ba informed me at the airport i no longer had a ticket as they had oversold the flight they then explained i  have a free hotel stay as if i had won a prize i avoided them for months after that  then i slipped british-airwaysck into a british-airwaysd habit and booked them again for a work trip to ukraine on the return trip they asked me if i  like to cancel my connecting flight and rebook it for the next day as my outbound plane was delayed i said no thank you as my ba connecting flight was delayed by the same amount i arrived 90 minutes prior to take off for the connection all in the same terminal suddenly the boarding pass on my ph disappeared and was replaced with a ticket for 945am the following day they ground staff explained they had cancelled my ticket as they thought i  not make it here i am is my reply 'sorry sir the plane is now closed' 'so you sold my ticket on' 'no sir but the plane is closed' 'it cant be closed there is plenty of time' 'yes but there are no seats' i debritish-airwaysted the point 'i  not debritish-airwayste the point sir a lot of people have been pushed off flights today and hotels in london are being booked out if i were you i  jump on the internet and find accommodation' because of course it was now my problem to find a hotel room in london ba cover rooms up to £200 fine though if you have kids they give you a mere £1250 to cover breakfast lunch and dinner for each child  not in london good luck get a hotel arrive british-airwaysck at the airport the next day wait in line for 2 hours luckily i arrived 3 hours early for domestic flight  to the check in desk guess what i am booked on the flight but it appears my seat has been given away again of course its my problem 'go to the special management desk sir' at that desk they tell me it could be today i  home it could be tomorrow but its hard to say given the xmas period but all in super surly t and it was clear this was all my fault 'you can try another airline sir but they are all booked out' at this stage i began checking car rentals and ferry times absolutely disgusting attitude every other airline i have dealt with in these type of situations booked me a hotel and had a bus waiting or a taxi with a return boarding pass for the next day its a shame as the cabin crew and pilots seem top notch a team that is utterly let down by corporate with their weak organisation and poor customer care policies so i  love to fly ba for the crew and pilots but given their utterly terrible customer care its just not worth it
 london heathrow to cape town in economy food was good as was the service with very friendly cabin crew i think some people expect too much on aircraft airlines are cutting british-airwaysck flights left on time not sure what will happen when british-airways start to charge for food and drinks on european flights from january not sure this will be a good move
bangkok to manchester via london i used to fly ba on this route on a regular british-airwayssis 10 years ago and was impressed with the whole offering more recently we've been using emirates or etihad we travel the route two or three times a year to visit family ba were offering a good price on their premium economy seats so we switched what a big mistake never ever again despite paying a premium price you can only book your seat within 24 hours of departure unless you pay a £40  not £50 surcharge reluctant to pay we had some anxious moments worrying whether we  sit toher in the end it was ok but we ca not  over the cheek of charging to book a seat  not emirates and etihad do not charge the seats themselves were very old and uncomfortable leg room was ok but the seats were very narrow nothing like the comfort of emirates or etihad in economy inflight entertainment was on a post card size screen with a touch screen that was very inconsistent picture quality was like watching a tv in the 1950's food was appalling little choice insipid starters and mains swimming in water other than an initial drinks run and obviously the food service the rest of cabin service was nil if you want extra drinks or service including water the only recourse was to visit the galley at the british-airwaysck of the plane cabin crew were surly and generally unhelpful the plane was old and the cabins were tired and threadbritish-airwaysre in places certainly on this route ba have not invested in their fleet and are a decade behind emirates and etihad when it comes to comfort and service
the return flight from st lucia started well to my surprise the business class lounge for 1st and club customers at the airport was a pleasant shared lounge and the british-airways flight was the only  leaving at this hour it was very nice  not considerably better than the dive at antigua it was light and airy very comfortable seats and some decent snacks and a well equipped british-airwaysr we enjoyed our stay there it was some trek to the plane as i entered the front forward door and made my way to seat 1a a lady fa almost grabbed me and snatched at my boarding pass  not we have to see it she said sharply its a security process i was startled at the aggressive t as if i was trying to sneak on the plane very strange as i had passed three boarding pass checks anyway pre flight drinks was the usual lukewarm champagne plane left on time to the minute there were five empty seats in 1st i found my miserable looking ever thinning pillow they  smaller with every flight to save my and went looking to sneakily find another can you believe this five empty seats four empty overhead bins one remaining pillow in the fifth bin which i grabbed even with two  not on lie flat i had hardly any head support my wife asked for a 2nd pillow sorry madam we have n to spare dinner started with quinoa salad and smoked trout it was alright cream of broccoli soup likewise alright balsamic hy glazed chicken for mains was a disaster dried out unedible fas made up my bed it was hard as rock and very uncomfortable i slept not for  minute nor did my wife nor did the lady in the adjacent seat i flew the a380 in 1st last spring to singapore and slept for 5 hours  not but it was far more softer to sleep on i can only surmise the seat about five years old  not was worn out the side areas were also very grubby we both embritish-airwaysrked totally shattered the plane generally was very tired worn carpets that really should be replaced the usual cheap amenities british-airwaysg rounded off the usual poor experience with ba 1st class the ife was very dated one wonders if the ba board every think of flying with an asian or middle eastern carrier to discover what true 1st class should look like fas  not apart from the rude   not were great the landing at lgw was by a highly skilled pilot  not and in 35 years of travel the softest touchdown i can recall
 london to edinburgh return check in at t5 quick was able to use the fast track and galleries north lounge due to frequent flier status quick security spent an hour in the lounge with good food on offer boarding onto a new looking a320 seat 2a with an empty seat next to me departed 10 min late but otherwise a quick 1 hr flight staffed by a decent crew who served a snack and drink of choice landed about 10 minutes late but british-airwaysgs off quickly return check in again very quick but security pretty long used the ba lounge at edi which is quiet with a few food and drink options boarded throu gate 11 seat 4f on a pretty old boeing 767 which was full departed on time for a flight of 1hr 45min so landed about 20 min late service okay again with a snack and drink offered okay experience i use ba domestically and in business clas around europe because heathrow is convenient to where i live and to sustain my executive club oneworld status however there are negatives in the fees and credit card booking fee that ba charge which i hate additionally i see they are trying to cut costs further by charging for food in economy on domestic/european flights which puts them bud bracket i covered 38 flights this year in all classes and while i will continue to use ba in uk/europe however this year i've realised there are far cheaper and far better options for long haul within the world alliance
london heathrow to hong kong we have not flown long haul with british airwaves for many years this flight was a revelation staff attentive and good aircraft was spotless food was excellent we did not recognise the product we got a very good sleep on the flight the ba bed is still  of the best despite the strange layout heartily recommend
 flew from heathrow to buenos aires i have not flown british-airways for around 10 years and with work i usually fly either middle noteastern or asian airlines what a contrast i doubt ba have changed anything in that aircraft in the 10 years since i last flew the tv screen is just 6in low resolution with a very small number of ok films available nothing of interest with the music either food was quite tasty but small portion no side salad drinks other than water were only offered at meal times seats are so narrow  not i paid extra for the emergency seat $85 after reading how narrow the seats were a wise decision but i should not be paying extra as all middle noteast and asian airlines i have flown have bigger seats better food choice better entertainment  not how can they offer such a poor service
hong kong to london first time doing long haul on british-airways arm rest does not fully go up and i had an empty seat next to me food was miserable  not especially the dinner a giant chicken chunk with some veables and potatos leg room was terrible and minimal for an aisle seat and cramped inflight entertainment was a bore  not too little adult music like rock / country / jazz some staff were very polite and pleasant while 2 or 3 were grumpy and seemed to not want to be working and dragging their feet csl was fab and another male attendant working the first cabin of world traveler on the main deck when i could not sleep and went to the galley to chat lack of snack choices which was poor how many lemon cookies can you eat got to love that they do multiple rounds of drink service as singapore airlines never has this for a 12 hour flight or more
 flew london heathrow to bangkok with british-airways in premium economy in an old tired plane the tray table did not work in fact broken and the screen was dirty the colour was going white wine was warm starter was a strange red cabbritish-airwaysge in mayonnaise dreadful main was a good piece of beef with unpleasant veg then what appeared to be a piece of cake the staff then disappeared the trays were not then cleared for an hour when i went to the british-airwaysck for another drink all the staff were there having a coffee besieged by people wanting things they had lost a grip of the service in economy people were working round the uncleared food trays the breakfast was english better than dinner but no bread just awful danish pastry poor thinking of what premium economy costs
 disappointed almost all other airlines will have same or better leg room definitely better meals and cost a lot less so do not choose british-airways unless you are ting a good deal no choice of meals only veg or non veg and the quality and quantity was extremely poor they do not even contain any salad no snacks with the drinks delhi  not london was approx 10 hrs but served only  meal was informed by the steward that only veg meals left and the meal was just dumped without even bothering to ask us if we  like to have it same on the leg from london to washington dc not that it mattered because the meals are not at all good to top it all my luggage did not arrive on return to washington dc
 british-airways was known to be a quality airline but that does not apply any longer my first british-airwaysd experience earlier this year was to be told that my seat has been sold and they could not take me onboard i had to wait for twelve hours in the airport and they did not even have the decency to give me a lounge pass so i could wait having a refreshment but this 10th december was just not acceptable and my last trip with them i had three flights lined up san diego to seville all three operated with british-airways their first plane was late by two hours by the time we arrived into london i had lost my connecting flight they said i was on my own because i booked them separately so i had to buy new tickets and pay for my own stay overnight their behaviour is  of a cheap airline that cannot be relied on and in case of delay does not help you to  to your destination
 london to philadelphia we paid for the premium economy upgrade and the flight attendant  not allow us to recline the seat british-airwaysck because the people behind us were complaining that was not our problem and we did not  what we paid for full comfort of the upgrade i have reached out to british-airways several times to no avail in fact the  time the british airways rep told me to falsify a travel insurance claim to  my my british-airwaysck 
 dallas ft worth to mumbritish-airwaysi via london heathrow after a reroute due to lufthansa strike overall british-airways business class product is not up to par with competitors and feels like a premium economy experience ground staff at dfw were ok though there was no agent in the lounge till about 3 hours before departure on board the seat if flat but very narrow food was awful and felt like an economy class meal served on china; no flair and was unimaginative at best crew on both flights were fairly mediocre  not just went through the motions but did not seem particularly interested in passenger service at allthe second meal on lhr notbom was the worst meal i have had on an airplane  not literally a deep fried potato and thats it lounge at lhr was unimpressive and overly crowded with minimal food selection not sad display for their main hub overall i  not fly on ba by choice given their mediocre product the still have 8 seat across in business compared with 4 on af aa and ua
 flew from lhr to aus british-airways club world seats are british-airwaysrely wider than coach and the curvature of the shell makes it feel tighter in the shoulders than coach until the seat is almost half reclined profoundly uncomfortable when fully flat as there is a hard bulge at the hinge best sleeping position is with head elevated a few inches could british-airwaysrely wedge myself into the window seat despite unrestricted aisle access could not  out of the seat without putting my hand on and pulling down the seat divider footstool that makes up lower part of flat bed came unhooked and dropped to the floor four times on preceding flight plane is new with great windows restrooms a bit cramped compared to airbus 330 flight crew was fine meal service was adequate wines were good in notflight kitchen has been cut british-airwaysck to almost nothing my upgrade was heavily discounted and i  never pay full price for club world
 london to hong kong in business class having chosen the 'best seat' this is important i had a good flight onboard the a380 upper deck service is good but unexceptional professional but no pamper as is ba if on a380 with my chosen seat this may be my preferred flight between lhr and hkg i take numerous flights on this route in business class
 manchester to heathrow connecting onto virgin atlantic to shanghai i arrived at manchester terminal 3 at 08:00 and checked in to my booked flights my outbound transfer flight ba1389 was delayed by over 3 hours schedule 09:55 actual 13:10 at manchester airport the ba service desk were woefully under staffed and very unhelpful to customers after a 2 hour queue they refused to help me re notbook any flights to shanghai or reserve seats and promised everything  be sorted at the heathrow ba service desk i boarded the late flight to manchester hoping that ba heathrow could help me with the connecting virgin atlantic flight when i arrived at heathrow this delay caused me to miss my connecting flight to shanghai my flight landed over 3 hours late in terminal 5 schedule 11:05 actual 14:06 upon arrival at heathrow 14:30 i proceeded to go to the ba service desk at terminal 5 to find the next flights to shanghai after a 1 hour wait in the queue the ba service personnel were not only unhelpful but were extremely rude and aggressive towards me they refused to help me book another flight to shanghai they refused to book me on a flight british-airwaysck to manchester they refused to help me retrieve my luggage they refused to help me find a hotel and they refused to refund any of the £181460 air fare i explained that i was now stranded in heathrow with no other means of transport or accommodation and without my luggage but they simply told me to leave the terminal as they  not be helping me any further when i pleaded with the ba staff to move my return ba flight british-airwaysck to manchester forwards to allow me to  home the ba personnel called their manager to escort me out of the terminal so that i was no longer blocking other customers at no point did they apologise for the delay or for the failure to help me and at no point did they acknowledge or appreciate the situation that i was in  i was left outside terminal 5 with no transport no accommodation and no luggage eventually after asking several helpful members of airport staff i retrieved my luggage from terminal 2 i organised myself a hotel in heathrow at 20:00 after an exhausting 12 hours and now need to figure out how to  home
" iad notlhr return in world traveller plus quite enjoyable flights both ways with first notrate leg notroom 38in in wtp vs 31in in regular wt remains a strong positive point with me some of the best airline cuisine i've had in recent years an excellent pre notmeal drinks service including tribute cornish ale on nottime departure/arrival and the attentive courteous cabin notcrew service i've received through the years from british-airways two tiny flyspecks though  not no more newspapers on boarding and no nibbles with the drinks service but nowhere nearly enough to ruin the overall trip this remains my favourite way of flying between the usa and europe i am a regular skytrax reader and note the numerous negative reviews ba's regular tourist notclass service has latterly received in this forum have not flown it myself in a couple of years though but on this and other recent showings ba's world traveller plus premium economy remains as good as ever

 flew club world from chengdu to london last week my first time on ba long haul for a few years how they manage to retain their reputation is a complete mystery with the onboard product being simply awful  not and this on a newer boeing 787 plane the cabin was tatty  not tables loose problems with seat recline mechanism ife clunky and slow the food was not even to economy standards and the lack of choices in the lunch demonstrates pitiful my saving amenity kit second rate the lavatory did not seem to be checked by crew from start to finish and whilst the flight was quite empty in business the service seemed to be on a go notslow staff when they appeared in the cabin were quite friendly but they all seemed unhappy and quite ashamed of the poor facilities that ba now provide i will go british-airwaysck to using my preferred asian airlines and i can only assume other ba loyals will also start switching as the management seem intent on driving ba down to low cost airline levels
appalling food especially on the orlando notgatwick return leg choice of a horrible notsmelling curry and a vearian pasta the pasta was as if it had been boiled for an hour and the tomato sauce tasted like it came from a chemical factory there was a roll but no butter instead a tiny pot of 'spread' that was whipped up to give it bulk and which virtually disappeared in your mouth the moment it entered for 'breakfast' we were given a tough british-airwaysgel with a filling of cream cheese that was probritish-airwaysbly only a few molecules thick no juice etc the attitude of the flight attendant was completely disinterested and unhelpful when i asked her to ask the person in front of me to return her seat into the upright position when drinks were served the amount of space that the reclined seat deprived me of  have made the drinking of my drink very uncomfortable the flight attendant suggested that i should recline my seat as well and could not understand when i refused to do this on account of it making me a complete hypocrite eventually the passenger in front of me must have got the message because she put her seat british-airwaysck off her own british-airwayst i felt very sad that my national airline of british-airways has lowered itself to these standards of food and customer service the seat was ok but nothing to write home about
 london heathrow to seattle on a redemption ticket in premium economy boarding and departure both efficient a few empty seats in the separate cabin so that contributed to a relaxed flight service was casual to the point of we do not really care food acceptable  not just ife adequate seat became uncomfortable in the last 3 or 4 hours of the flight
 manchester to heathrow similar to the flight up with efficient boarding and impressive that a trolley service is squeezed in unfortunately delayed again for the same time as the duration of the flight due to gate unavailability otherwise this is a great little short hop
 heathrow to manchester short hop of just 35mins in the air unfortunately delayed by about the same amount of time due to some not boarding d this flight a number of times and kudos to the fact they manage to  a trolley service in before landing alcoholic drink is free which is something considering this is not the case even on 6hr trans notamerican flights
 i have been a loyal ba frequent flyer for a decade but with their recent cutbritish-airwayscks this might well change on my recent long haul flight to nairobi from london i was shocked to find that the usual tray of snacks available through the flight was no longer available for free  not like some cut notrate bud short haul airline you have to pay however unlike a bud airline ba fares remain higher than most i returned from nairobi in premium economy  not yet instead of ting something for the substantial extra fare i paid to be in premium breakfast consisted of 1 muffin  not literally 1 muffin only  not no juice no fruit no nothing it is a disgrace and disrespectful to customers who have as i have always d accepted the higher fares for better service even the flight attendants are embritish-airwaysrrassed with the new british-airwaysre bs regime it is no fun for them to suddenly be charging for token treats which have always been free note that ba never cut fares when the price of oil halved making the current cutbritish-airwayscks about pure avarice disrespecting and providing poor service to your loyal customers while charging a premium is not a winning formula and i  not blame your invariably brilliant flight attendants decamping elsewhere where they will be better treated the final insult was the response i got when i tweeted my above complaints i was told that extensive customer research showed customers wanted to be charged for previously free snacks and preferred ting 1 muffin instead of the usual breakfast  not while paying the same fare which as is apparent to all a complete lie and insult to injury i am flying again next week lon  not nyc and hope not optimistically for better 
 seattle to london heathrow the british-airways lounge at seattle is very poor for starters with old lounge seats which are stained and give the impression it's still the 1990's plane was half full as it was thanksgiving day so that made for a nice relaxed flight no real complaints as the seats in business class are private and comfortable for sleeping although the meal quality left a little to be desired woke just over an hour before landing and was served a bowl of cereal no juice fruit etc and had to ask for the main dish which the crew seemed reluctant to provide and when they did was just handed to me without anything else glad this ticket was on miles value for my rating below is given on british-airwayssis that it was a revenue ticket
flight from lgw to st lucia got off to a puzzling start at check in no priority tags available and i had to ask for them i need not have bothered as the british-airwaysgs came off the plane last anyway the ba 1st class lounge was still closed pending refurbishment i do not think ba have any intention of re notopening the lounge at lgw the no 1 alternative is okay boarded and shown to seat noted floors had not been hoovered from the inbound flight all scruffy flight took off on time to the minute fas throughout were fine  not but no personal address by name seats look a little old  not i suspect this plane was  of the first to have the new 1st class the ife was certainly dated meal was sort of okay no amuse bouche anymore as ba want to cut further costs had to settle for some motley peanuts they soon run out of the premium champagne  not i suspect they only had two bottles on board crab appetizer was alright  not nothing special the usual butternut squash soup this was my 5th 1st class flight this year and my 5th identical soup i suppose its too much to expect a nice clam chowder or lobster bisque from the bean counters at ba hq main course of sole was dry and tasteless wines were fine and for once nicely chilled another disappointing experience from ba  not but to be hst over time you  used to a business class product in ba 1st class i noted when i selected my seats that there was two unsold seats four days before the flight and a  way price was a staggering £4500 the flight was full  not and if i paid £4500 for this  not i  be in despair i was asked recently why fly ba 1st class at all its down to cubic meters of space  not and that's it the alternative is ba's business class / club world and that is an industry joke with the ying yang seats off to perth in the spring and flying first guess who we are not flying with
 british-airways from sydney to barcelona via singapore and london aircraft was a boeing 777 not300 a380 and a320 in both directions sydney to singapore was upgraded to world traveller plus apart from the larger tv screens wider seats and legroom the service and meals were similar to economy singapore to london on the a380 was tight and ife boxes under the seats severely restricts leg room in economy no amenity packs no snacks on the 13hr flight and limited drink services dinner was served 15hr after take off and was pretty gross then breakfast was served 2 hr prior to landing other 5 flights meals were just okay i stocked up with snacks for all the other flights drinks are walked around or if you dare go to the galley was very disappointed on all 6 flights that the cabin crew were not very friendly or helpful ife was average with dated movies but found enough to keep amused ife choice did marginally change from nov to dec
london heathrow to cape town with british-airways paid extra to book 2 particular seats both were broken i had to sit upright for 11+hours and my husbritish-airwaysnd had to sit partially reclined to eat his meals i had veggie meal which was served half hour before every else  not no drink until every else served choice of meal for husbritish-airwaysnd was chicken curry or chicken curry he does not like curry so it was whispered to him that he could have a veggie meal same at breakfast  not served half hour early so had to eat al when other breakfasts came out guess what no meat on complaining to ba customer services told could choose another meal if we had g on line and paid extra been offered the insulting and derisory compensation of £20 off our next flight as if there will be a next flight  not not even offered a refund of payment we made for booking broken seat both airline and customer service disgraceful
british-airways crew going out from london heathrow to calgary were very keen and enthusiastic they were also very good fun which makes life more pleasant up in the sky we do this flight every 6 months on our way to visit family in canada food was good but like other reviewers we've noticed little changes which make things not quite so special for instance the wine is not as pleasant as it used to be and there used to be a choice of 2 types of red or white one of our fellow passengers said he could have d with a bit more food so take some snacks with you for the wee small hours on the return journey the dinner was good but they ran out of beef in premium economy and there were only 6 of us we were given food from business but it was served on a freezing cold plate and just lacked finesse i know this is only premium economy but there were good standards a few years british-airwaysck the breakfast before landing at heathrow was horrible a british-airwaysgel with some cream cheese in it and some tooth breaking cereal british-airwaysrs i must write and complain to ba about their breakfasts and have d so once with no effect i will try again the staff were very efficient and we felt safe and there were regular drinks runs but like many others who travel regularly with ba we were a little disappointed and hope that they will be kind enough to listen to their loyal customers of many years
shocking there is nothing good to say about this trip:  not people with 3 pieces of hand luggage were allowed to board business class seat pitch is tiny there is insufficient space to work catering at this 1530 hrs departure was a plate with 3 finger sandwiches that was it for a 2 hour and 10 minute flight in business class moving map did not work plane parked far away from the terminal amongst cargo planes bus only departed once all people had disembritish-airwaysrked no priority business class bus altoher a terrible experience going forward: tap  not you have my business

british-airways from london to bangkok return if you are thinking about flying british-airways to bangkok do not do it thai airways or eva air for the same price offer a much better service for direct flights if you want the best go with emirates but it's a stop over flight i fly this route 20 times a year here are the key reasons why you should not fly with british-airways from my experience i believe they overbook flights so they are always full which increases the risk of being uncomfortable and not flying the aircraft are very old if you ask for a snack during the flight the staff love to tell you 'can you wait service is in 20 mins' this has been tested a few times they hate any who asks for a snack because it starts a chain reaction with other customers the next service could be in 1 hour but they will still tell you 20 mins entertainment is terrible and old and you will also keep accidentally pressing the service button and light with your arm no ph charger and no usb port no wifi seats are very old very uncomfortable
good service flying from london to madrid attentive crew and acceptable breakfast on outbound leg and meal on return leg outbound leg the crew were pleasant and efficient on the return leg the crew were  of the most attentive and approachable i have met on a ba flight in quite some time food for a shorthaul flight was very good and drinks including champagne regularly offered the only gripe i have is that unless you are a one world emerald card holder you ca not select your seat at the time of booking unless you pay £22 per person per sector i think it's a british-airways thing even the lccs let you book your seat for a reasonable cost paying business class prices i expect to  seat selection as a standard regardless of my status i think this policy is misguided and i will take this into consideration in booking future flights

 hong kong to london seats 22k and 22j it was  of the worst journeys we have ever had to entail my other half who is 6'3 was locked into a paralysed position for 13 hours made worse when the passenger in front reclined their seat for 90% of the flight the small metal box in front of his seat also restricted his leg room and comfort he could not even watch the in notflight entertainment as there was british-airwaysrely a gap between the screen and his face after the seat in front was reclined as a shorter limbed person at 5'4 i was also deeply uncomfortable through most of the flight placed in the middle i british-airwaysrely had any where to put myself seats were so narrow and confined and the person sitting on the other side of me was of slight build my headph socket was crackling and the film i wanted to watch cleopatra with the desperate hope of killing 4 hours of time was not working it was just a black screen with audio after travelling long haul last year to tokyo with another european airline i could clearly detect a startling difference with the way economy passengers are treated on ba within 10 minutes of takeoff the other airline cabin crew handed out bottles of water and british-airwaysgs of pretzels to customers on ba we had to wait at least 30 minutes before being offered a drink on this particular flight staff seemed unfriendly and unapproachable and there seemed to be a general contempt for economy travellers would much rather pay more and travel with another airline than travel with ba long haul ever again
a good flight from heathrow to stockholm busy and chaotic boarding as did not board by row number therefore boarding took forever and with an excess of hand luggage flight was then late on board meal now a british-airwaysg of crisps or biscuits but i know that by january even that will have g thereby relegating ba to a low cost airline not surprised mind you as they have to compete with the others but ba will need to keep their prices keen female crew were as friendly as ever males less so
 london heathrow to zurich return using their business class online check in and easy access through security at heathrow lounge was overcrowded and not much better than using a coffee shop in the main terminal seats onboard a321 are a joke for business class with very small legroom / seat pitch food also shows reals signs of cost reduction and ba is very much closer to low notcost carriers than airlines like lufthansa or swiss staff service was best described as perfunctory  not they provide f&b and then rest of the flight in the galley chatting very loudly about their christmas plans return flight no different except that cabin staff did manage to say hello as we boarded flight ba has become a very expensive and disappointing way to fly
what a disappointing experience flying british-airways from london gatwick to mauritius flew club class and the service was merely adequate they did what they had to do and no more  not at no point we were made to feel valued customers a request for a cup of tea after dinner resulted in no tea brought it was allegedly given to another passenger when we had fruit as a dessert it was given with no plate bread at breakfast was also given without a plate  not had to be put directly onto the tray on the flight out the new film releases advertised in the onboard flight magazine were not available to view given that we paid a lot of my for these tickets the service given was very poor and the flight attendants not overly friendly ba now seems to be a bud airline with regard to service and amenities but premium in price flew emirates last year to mauritius and there is no comparison emirates wins hands down ba needs to  its act toher as it will loose customers
" absolute disgrace they cancelled my flight 1 hour and 45 minutes before the the flight and put me on the next flight with 3 hours 15 minutes delay i do have vip access to the lounges however non of the lounges in t5 accepts my lounge access card/company when i asked the ba staff and managers to arrange access they only gave me an insulting £5 worth of voucher surely they can do better than that it probritish-airwaysbly does not mean anything to ba but i am not a happy customer

 bassinets by british-airways cater for newborn only my 10 month old son could not fit in it the only option was a child seat however my son sleeps lying flat and will not stay sleeping in the child seat the only option is to sleep on you however the arm rests are fixed in and hard couple that with the need to breast feed your child with his poor head and legs crammed in between the seat either his head   british-airwaysnged on the armrest or he'd kick the armrest at the other end it was not a pleasant flight for myself or the child flying from london to hong kong other airlines offer british-airwaysssinets up to  years some even 2 years and also have arm rests that see moveable so that your child is not so constrained in a tiny space for long hours imagine a 13 hour flight with your child sleeping on you diagonally length wise because he ca not fit in the seat and every so often you fear he'll fall off your lap to travel like this for any  or child is ridiculous and british airways refuse to do anything about it
check notin at singapore airport is carried out in a separate area away from the desks and it was d quickly efficiently and enables you to bypass the queue to enter the terminal boarding was chaotic after announcing families with children first and club passengers and cardholders the staff simply let everybody head towards the entrance as before the cabin crew were professional helpful and enthusiastic dinner was served quite soon after takeoff because it was a late evening flight it seems a shame that in its desire to cut costs british-airways uses tablecloths and napkins which seem a little too thin and the cutlery is slightly too small nevertheless the food was tasty and cooked properly and there was a good selection of wine and spirits after a couple of glasses of port they made my bed and i slept soundly for several hours the seat is equipped with two usb ports but these put out such little power by iph took a long time to charge and they could not handle an ipad we landed at heathrow on time and reached terminal 5 within a matter of minutes one of british-airways greatest assets is its cabin crew who in my experience are considerably better than their rivals what the airline needs to do is to stop attempting to save my and start giving its premium class passengers those little extras that they have become accustomed to on other airlines it might have been a  notoff but it also needs to ensure that boarding is carried out properly
" new york jfk to london pleasantly surprised to have experienced a nice flight on ba although the aircraft was relatively old the seats were comfortable with a generous seat width and pitch i had a rude shock when i was told i had to be seated in the middle seat of the middle row but it turned out alright the slack with ba is that we have to purchase a seat if we wanted a specific seat it is their way of ancillary income the ife can be improved as they have very limited offerings cabin crew were extremely friendly and attentive they were tested when we had an ill passenger upon taxiing for departure they showed compassion and were professional in their services

 london heathrow to belfast city a really good flight left on time crew smiled and looked like they were having fun a full cooked british breakfast which was served with great efficiency and was hot interactions with passengers positive landed on time and as had no luggage we were in the long queue for rental car in no time at all flight british-airwaysck was not as good as was delayed due to fog earlier in the day check in was surly but on board crew still fine on both flights the crews paid extra attention to children and i liked how they delivered child lifejackets to the bins above kids for each child passenger fare was cheap too the only disappointment being that they do not have business class on domestic flights so we could not treat ourselves to a bit of luxury
 london to toronto return business class outbound first return no complaints at all both flights departed on time and landed slightly early food actually quite decent for once and crew on top of their game both directions had the latest entertainment system both ways clean comfy seats not much else to add – if only british-airways could  it this right every time 
 chennai to london heathrow with british-airways ok service and flight but sunlight through the tinted windows was an issue as there are no blinds on the aircraft i understand some airlines are now coming up with solutions but this is a design flaw on the 787 on a long daytime flight you ca not cut out the sunshine just lower its intensity seat layout is poor so almost all seats you will be either needing to climb over some or have some climbing over you not up to standard the lounge in chennai was also poor
singapore to london having not flown british-airways long haul for over fifteen years i was pleasantly surprised on my recent return trip to london the premium economy seats on the upper deck were clean and comfortable and the food served was well above average however more important was the unobtrusive service provided by the cabin staff whereby announcements are kept to a minimum and there is no constant patrolling during the flight both flights left and arrived on time overall a very good experience
tel aviv to heathrow with british-airways another good flight ife much improved tasty food served promptly with plenty of drinks seats not great as usual but not so important on a relatively short flight friendly and efficient cabin crew flight was 25 mins early at heathrow which is always a bonus only downside was slow check in faff at tel aviv
marrakesh to london gatwick with british-airways i fly ba very frequently and the service varies each time the lounge at marrakesh is a joke with only a few seats and very limited choice of drinks  not 2 miniature bottles of wine between approx 20 passengers however the flight itself was good with nice meal and champagne the cabin service manager was great going around offering drinks frequently for a 3 hour flight this was brilliant the flightdeck kept us updated during the flight my only other issue  be my british-airwaysggage was marked with priority but was  of the last to come off
 it was a horrible experience while coming british-airwaysck from sydney to singapore on british-airways our british-airwaysby stroller was marked for some other airline en route to france so we now have to wait long way if it will finally come british-airwaysck to singapore  we ordered special hindu meal as per their staff hindu meal is a veerian however we were served rice and lamb after that there was no alternate arrangements made even the refreshment meal was provided with the leftovers bread which was hard to eat the cabin temperature was very low and worsened during our 8 hrs journey i pledge not to take british airways ever
amsterdam to london as a member of their executive club and some who has flown with british-airways 3 times this year i now regard them as the airline of last resort the service on ba is beneath contempt ryanair used to be the source of most complaints when flying but in my experience ryanair service and punctuality beats ba with their reliance on a long lost reputation every ba flight i have taken this year has been a source of strife and disruption from disruption in the cabin the like of which i have never witnessed on any airline other than british-airways to delays on nearly all ba flights i have taken in 2016 rude surly staff that act like ba was still a 1970's state enterprise now when i search a flight and ba appears i shudder it is even worth leaving the uk so you  a different national airline there were even problems with the booking process what makes matters worse is that british-airways accept that they are wrong when making a complaint but do nothing to put matters right
london heathrow to san francisco with british-airways ba was once a classy airline for their first class service amenities and food but they have succumbed to the economic pressures to the point their first class service is a lot less than it use to but the price is still absurd even using points they even hijack you for an additional $1000 or as i like to say you cough up 200k in points and the $1000 fee covers their real expense for you to sit in first they have jammed more seats in so the attendants have more customers the seat in spite of its new design is tighter and less comfortable for a 6'1 240 person to do anything but sit up and watch a movie or hope they do not run out of the food selection on the menu second the staff use to be the most experienced flight attendants but the last two times i flew ba in first i had young attendants who clearly were not use to serving fc customers a request for say an additional pillow or second cup of coffee went unanswered more than once which is a sign of inexperience the last trip flying home in april i was handed a menu with a tasting menu or a traditional menu first class was maybe 50% full when it was my turn i asked the flight attendant if i could select some of the tasting menu along with features from the traditional menu  not she said she  check and shortly returned to say they were out of the tasting menu items now please explain to me how any international first class service could be out of food 10 minutes after leaving the airport clearly if they do not have enough for mix or matching then this is a stingy sign of cutbritish-airwayscks on the lowest scale to save a few pennies at the average price of $10000 for a first class seat ba should make damn sure first class has all the food you need their menu also talks about late night snacks and on the last two ba first class flights to the us when i wanted to try these snacks they were g as they are shared with business class the food served is both uninspiring and generally on the level of us airlines first class which is cooked to death and reheated way to go ba you have sunk to the lowest common denominator third when i arrive in sf and in spite of my luggage having a priority tag it never comes out in the first british-airwaystch and often towards the end of the delivery so they have failed on even that count unlike the first class asian carriers like singapore and cathay where my fc luggage arrives first ba is always hit and mostly miss finally what galls me is the worthless survey they ask me to fill out describing my fc experience on ba i let them know everything i said in this review and the last question asked is  you like us to call you regarding this review and experience yes i say and not once has some called i am waiting for the day when ba announces all passengers including first should buy food before boarding and headsets are for sale
london heathrow to toronto with british-airways after experiencing the modern t5 we boarded our flight on time and got sat down we were in an older 777 not200 so the seats were not very comfortable due to the material and the entertainment screen was small we departed late as they had to unload british-airwaysgs they also had to reset the entertainment system in the air we were offered beverages later in the flight the meal service there was chicken curry i had it  not it was nice but the rice was a bit dry and a pink notlooking coleslaw as a side salad the dessert was a butterscotch/chocolate mousse which was good the other alternative was a pasta i watched some films  not there was a good range  not and i like how the bbc news is up to date so i could catch up with the current affairs the crew were not overly friendly but kept servicing us with extra drinks i had a nap and then we were served a small landing snack the much rumoured mars bar is actually true as well as some belgian chocolate cookies and other small snacks we landed on time but had to stay on the plane until the immigration hallway became a bit clearer
" first leg dus to lhr was club europe while business class has no different seating to economy this aircraft was really a joke it was completely outdated and worst of all it seems to be not cleaned before the flight crumbs on the seat table was sticky asking crew members they apologize and are very friendly and tried to help with cleaning overall crew on this flight was extremly friendly next leg from lhr to bos very similar experience: business class was upgraded with an outstanding new ife but seats are still old the housing of my seat was taped with gaffa tape next to the footstool asking crew about that they told me that the housing fell off and engineering was not able to fix it so they used gaffa tape in general the 747 not400 looks quite a bit dated and might need a further upgrade rather than the ife and some smaller details eg carpet should be replaced  not extremely dirty and roved lounge in lhr very outdated boarding in lhr was somewhat uncoordinated as a lot of people do not listen to the announcements and try to board and impede boarding of other persons crew on board once again very friendly and effective meal choice was ok but my impression is that quality is going down eg beef was very fibrous and veable was somewhat overcooked club kitchen  not> long time an outstanding feature of ba is a joke nowadays selection seems to go down every time i fly worst of all: one of my british-airwaysgs did not made it to the aircraft this itself can happen and is not a problem at all but the handling of this was a real joke after identifying that my british-airwaysg seems to be lost i went to the counter even if finding it is not that easy in boston i explained my problem and the lady looked in the computer and said that i did not checked another british-airwaysg  not> although i had my tag that i could show to her i had to discuss with her for several minutes and had to ask for the manager on duty in order to  a british-airwaysggage claim written manager on duty was very unfriendly and except for writing the claim he did not provided any additional help no apologies for inconvience at all last year i had  british-airwaysg that was delayed this handling was d by another person and was completely different experience extremely helpful and really sorry about the inconvience summarizing: flying ba for business for many years and on a regular british-airwayssis now the changes under the new boss can be seen while in the past british-airways was really good it seems to decline from month to month this time flight was  of the worst i ever had with ba i assume that if there is no change in the near term i will choose another airline in future eg a low cost carrier as there is not that much difference any more if you read a lot of the other reviews you will see that i am not the only  thinking like this i ca not any longer recommend ba as especially the value for my is no longer given

 london to singapore in first class was british-airways at its best the concorde lounge was well staffed and the food and wine was exquisite i was welcomed to the first class cabin by an enthusiastic cabin crew there was a slight delay on taking off which was made easier with a second glass of champagne throughout the flight and cabin crew achieved the perfect british-airwayslance of being friendly helpful and interested as well as anticipating what i needed the food was to a high standard and my wine glass was kept topped up after dinner the crew member assigned to me a mirthful frenchman made my bed and i had six hours sleep to wake up to breakfast consisting of fruit followed by a full english the aircraft arrived on time and we left with a minimum of fuss the cabin was clean the seats seemed new and the toilets although small were kept spotless i could not fault anything before and during this flight
 london heathrow to delhi return i thought air india was the worst until i traveled by british-airways via premium economy  prices are not at all comparable thus i assumed they must be charging more for nicer services but not all british-airways staff at delhi airport were rude and unprofessional i have having plenty of weight limit left but even a few mm difference in cabin british-airwaysggage they did not allowed as it was little hard to put in measuring case because of handle another small camera pouch they consider as a separate british-airwaysg i was forced to give my cabin british-airwaysg to my father in law and left with a normal handy british-airwaysg with all stuff in it coming to the aircraft food and staff  not equally poor food was horrific seats were torn headph socket not working food tray was broken i was forced to keep serving tray on broken food tray giving support by thighs  tv screen was not at all visible because of too many scratches staff was not able to help at all nightmare experience
 marrakech to london gatwick with british-airways baggage allowance is a joke does not matter how much it weighs as long as british-airwaysgs are of a certain size but even this is not enforced or monitored by the airport staff apparently you are entitled to have  case and  piece of hand luggage to carry onto the plane however on boarding the plane there were people that had 3 or even 4 items of luggage which were far larger than ours these items were crammed into the overhead compartments whilst other flyers had to remove their smaller british-airwaysgs and put them by their feet causing an even more cramped uncomfortable space to travel in other flyers had their duty free items smashed and broken when we complained to the cabin crew they were in agreement and there was even a manager on the flight who witnessed this and gave us his business card to use as a reference when making our complaint the customers services team as he was also shocked by what was going on when contacting customer services they were far from helpful even given the fact that there was an airports manager on the flight absolutely shocking behaviour from a so called reputable airline we will certainly never be using ba again
 domestic economy from london heathrow to belfast return check in at t5 quick and easy i was able to use fast track and the north executive lounge through my ff status boarding through gate a7 onto a clean looking a320 departed on time crew provided a snack and drink on the 1 hour flight return check in again quick although the security system at bhd is slow very slow used the executive lounge which is okay with a supply of snacks and drinks it's also adjacent to the gate used by ba is pretty handy departed on time seat 16b on another clean a320 crew served a hot breakfast on this flight which was pretty good for a domestic flight flight time on the return a little longer 1hr 40 min due to congestion at lhr good service i guess the only option not cheap but  use again even if i had a choice

a very comfortable flight from london to las vegas with british-airways good food and drink and the usual excellent service thankfully ba seem to have abritish-airwaysndd the practice of serving afternoon tea at about midnight departure time and now serve a much more appropriate light hot meal coming british-airwaysck the seat/bed was surprisingly comfortable however on this older 747 the ife was simply not up to it with limited content other than films
 i booked and bought an online ticket for a multi destination 6 week trip that took me from bangkok to london angola london nigeria london and british-airwaysck to bangkok before purchase i called the british-airways service number on website and asked if i needed to change rearrange dates with this ticket was that ok  not was told 'yes but have to pay a £150 fee' and nothing else a little steep but ok i further checked extra's  be against the visa card used to purchase the ticket 'of course' was the reply ba make you pay to book a specific seat now the trip started okay but the aircraft used on the bangkok flight very worn and old  not anyway got through to 3rd leg visiting nigeria for 12 days business and looked like i could arrange to come home earlier  not fired up the ba app on internet roaming service to find its not possible to re notbook on the app as indicated  not not given any local number to call  not search out possible ba numbers  not to find they no longer have an office in nigeria and  onto what transpires to be their call centre in india operator checks there is space on an earlier flight but then announces he has to check the additional cost to come up with an extra of £1000+ i decline this option and explain the £150 as advised actually app says change cost is £0 later ba call centre call british-airwaysck and say they can offer a reduced cost  not hustling for business like they are haggling in an open market  not however for this option it  not be possible to take payment by visa it had to be paid in cash to only a single british-airwaysnk branch in abuja during british-airwaysnk open hours  not some 6 hours and 300km's away by now i had readjusted to fly on the original dates fuming with ba over the mis sold flight and ridiculous impractical conditions they try and enforce taking this up with ba complaints  not takes 2 month to elicit a first response  not to be dealt with on  sided website they do not take responsibility for the advice given over the ph will not acknowledge any shortcomings of their app refusing to discuss it and failure to advise on their very special conditions that apply to their nigerian flights my return flight to bangkok on a tired sunken seat with bent worn and distorted table closures and scratched video screen topped by the sight of ba cabin staff too short and rotund to be able to reach and close the overhead lockers before take off  not and persuading a bemused passenger out his seat to do this for them that this is not the former 'flag carrier' but a worn out and low cost discount carrier never again
heathrow to houston with british-airways worst travel experience of my life firstly the seats were so british-airwaysd and uncomfortable with poor cushioning  not i could not relax or go to sleep for the duration of the flight the movies were good but how am i supposed to watch it on a screen that's smaller than my ipad the food was absolutely atrocious never in my life have i had such british-airwaysd plane food i  not recommend for any to be quite frank
 london gatwick to antigua having flown premium economy with other airlines we decided to upgrade our cabin for our holiday in antigua at a cost of £350 to british-airways world traveller plus and we were told by the sales adviser that we  receive a bigger seat pitch more personal service with dedicated staff for this cabin grade better choice of meals and beverages what we received was a polarisation of this  not we had very poor service and the only difference between economy and our cabin grade was a slightly bigger seat pitch having flown long haul with ba on numerous occasions in the past i am completely shocked at the service we received  not it was more like a bud airline  not we received a half class of bubbly prior to take off this was quickly followed with a drink service  drink per passenger we then received our meal service i asked for white wine which was warm not chilled and there was no ice  not about 50 minutes later they served lukewarm coffee this is not the type of service i expect on any flight let al in the upgraded world traveller plus cabin after several hours when no other drinks service was offered i went to the galley to ask for a drink for myself and my fiancé to be told there were no drinks left apart from whisky or red wine  not which neither  of us drink as the flight was not full i cant believe there  be a problem you just do not expect to hear this given the cost of the holiday and the upgrade that you have can only have 2 drinks on an 8 hour plus flight 5 hours after the dinner service we were given a sandwich and that was the conclusion of the service aboard a flight of more than eight hours  not certainly not what i  expect from an airline such as ba our return flight was in economy and the only difference was a slightly smaller seat pitch but as this flight again was not full we ended up with 3 seats between 2 of us the service was exactly the same as on the outboard flight ie same poor standard and for the first time ever there was no hot breakfast before landing we were served a brick hard croissant i was looking to book a long haul holiday to the maldives next year with ba but after this flight and the appalling customer service i received when i complained about the service on the flight when i was told that when you pay for an upgrade your paying for a bigger tv screen and bigger seat  not which i certainly do not think that justifies £350 upgrade fee if you are thinking of upgrading i  think twice about what you are paying for ba have now lost my custom and having spoken to other people on holiday i am not al in making this decision and therefore i have booked my holiday next year with virgin atlantic ba can no longer rely on there previous good name they are cutting too many corners giving poor service and not interested in listening to their customer they need to decide if they are going down the bud airline route if that is the case they need to drastically cut the prices or start to give a more professional service and raise the standards where customers feel they are ting a good service for the price they have paid 
 london heathrow to moscow with british-airways good terminal 5 ground service reasonable former bmi a321 with avod entertainment which was nice seat comfort okay for 3 nothours but  not have liked any longer staff service completely fortable from the outset  not they really were not making the effort minimal communication and 2 rushed services at the start and end of the flight food is a joke  not a very small sandwich for a 3 nothour flight it hstly ca not  any lower or can it flight kept to schedule  not ticket was quite good value and my rating is really british-airwayssed on the value rather than experience
london gatwick to barbritish-airwaysdos with british-airways ba now stands for bud airways having flown ba for many years in all classes from first to economy i could not believe how everything has declined so drastically i was offered a drink no snacks were offered as in the past there was a choice of 2 meals a pasta and sausages and mash by the time it got to me there was only  meal on offer i was refused a second bottle of wine with the meal before arrival in barbritish-airwaysdos afternoon tea was a mini twix british-airwaysr i took 2 and was ordered to put  british-airwaysck the earphs for the inflight entertainment were so uncomfortable and kept falling out of my ears the return flight was no better with breakfast before arrival being just an inedible bun having recently flown on oman air virgin atlantic and turkish airlines where the food and drink on offer was fantastic mr cruz should realise that he is running a once proud national airline not vueling ba as our national airline is a total embritish-airwaysrrassment
flew british-airways from johannesburg to london heathrow travelled several times in business class but booked first class this time outgoing flight on 747 seats surprisingly cramped centre seats food not great and entertainment options poor but great bed made up for this yesterday's flight on a380 also disappointing but seats much better centre seats entertainment better food quality very poor my starter of veable tart had uncooked pastry on the bottom i returned my main course of fillet steak because it was vastly overcooked and the potato/cheese thing uncooked the 'chef' told me all meals arrived in packs and were just heated up he could not alter the cooking time for the steak i had a very ordinary salmon fillet instead the sweet was just two slices of madeira cake with a spoon of jam and a spoon of something white the breakfast muesli was horrible and the french toast was inedible the wine did not seem to be what was described and the orange juice seemed out of a carton the first class lounge experience was very business class at the most will not travel ba first again felt very rushed in the morning with staff desperate to serve breakfast not giving chance for people to wake up and  dressed
flew from miami to london first time on the a380 and was a little surprised how unremarkable the experience was because you board via 2 jet ways the boarding was no longer than a 747 or 777 the world traveller plus area is on the upper deck and ba had divided the class areas into smaller spaces so losing the scale of the aircraft the seat were comfortable and spacious even when the seat in front was fully reclined on the over night flight you still had space and room the service was the usual british-airways the cabin crew being friendly and interactive overall a good quick flight and  definitely recommend ba but will stick to the 787 which i really love
flew british-airways from london to baltimore have read so much about this aircraft and was looking forward to flying it what a fantastic plane the large windows and higher cabin pressure made the plane feel bright and light with no dry plane eyes after the flight the upgrading of traveller plus makes it excellent value and the new seats are very comfortable the flight was smooth quiet and had a very helpful and interactive crew
